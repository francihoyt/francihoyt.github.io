<p>When I was driving through Philly with Margaret, I was just happily snapping pictures of stuff out of the car while we were driving. I happened to take this picture of a city centre sculpture and when I went through the photos afterwards I saw how perfectly (total fluke) the moon was aligned with this thing. It almost looks like some ethereal trumpet birthing a little half moon bubble.</p>
