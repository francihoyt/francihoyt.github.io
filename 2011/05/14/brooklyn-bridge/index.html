<p>When Ben’s dad was here back in April we got a fair bit of sight-seeing done, which even included some things I hadn’t seen or done before, which was pretty exciting. One of those things was walking the Brooklyn Bridge, which is just one of those things you <em>have to</em> do in New York City. Now that I’ve done it, I understand why. The views are amazing, and the architecture lends itself to some really cool photos. Here are some for your enjoyment. :-)</p>
<p>We walked the bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan — it almost feels like you’re going to walk straight into the high rises in downtown!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00914.jpg"><img title="Walking the bridge" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00914.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Two cuties joined us on our walk, and not a word of complaining was uttered!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00899.jpg"><img title="2 cuties" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00899.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Emily Roebling was quite the woman. You can read about all the struggles involved in building the bridge, and what part she played in its construction <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_bridge">here</a>.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00905.jpg"><img title="Great woman!" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00905.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Here’s Dad doing the touristy thing of having his photo taken on the bridge.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00913.jpg"><img title="Dad on the bridge" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00913.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of padlocks on the bridge with people’s names engraved on them — sort of like graffiti that says ‘John was here’ but without the spray paint.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00922.jpg"><img title="Leave your lock" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00922.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>In my mind, there is some kind of inherent beauty in symmetry.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00915.jpg"><img title="Cool lines" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00915.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="559" height="746" /></a></p>
<p>Looking toward the south west, you can see Lady Liberty in the distance and the big sky scrapers of Lower Manhattan.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00908.jpg"><img title="View of The Lady and Downtown" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00908.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And looking north east, you can see the Manhattan bridge along with the famous Empire State Building and the Chrysler building in the distance.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00902.jpg"><img title="View of Midtown" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00902.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Spring comes even to concrete jungles. I can’t stop raving about how beautiful spring has been here in NYC — a photo post on that coming soon!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/05/dsc00924.jpg"><img title="Signs of Spring" src="/images/2011/05/dsc00924.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>I love the different bridges! I would also recommend walking the Manhattan bridge, you can get a little closer view of the scenery without all the cables and traffic of the Brooklyn Bridge. The Manhattan Bridge walkway is on the outside edge of the bridge. There is only a chain-link fence separating you from the views… It is a really fun place to get some cool pics, as well.<br>
On another note, I LOVE SPRING IN NEW YORK CITY!!!!! I also really miss Brooklyn. Maybe I will be able to find something to bring me back out there. :) Love and miss you guys!</p>

<p>Nice work on the symmetry pic!  Did you manage to not get run over by bicycles when you took it?</p>
