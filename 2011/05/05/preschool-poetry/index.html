<p>Last Friday, Marica’s <a href="http://mangosplacedaycare.com/">preschool</a> put on a poetry recital that parents were invited to. The kids had all worked hard at memorising the poems — they recited 3 poems and then sung <em>Mary had a little lamb, </em>and they did really well! It was all themed for spring and was about rain, baby animals and flowers. Here are some cute photos of the action:</p>

<p>In New York, everything has to be compact, even where kids’ backpacks and lunch boxes go. Notice the stack of stuff in the background? Those are the cots for naptime.</p>

<p>A nice opportunity to get a photo of just Marica and me.</p>

<p>Love the photos! Especially you with your big girl. She looks happy and we are thankful that she settled in so well.</p>
