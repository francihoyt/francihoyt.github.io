<p>The other day Marica decided to start running laps between our bed and the couch in the lounge, a distance of about six or seven metres. After a few laps she started counting, “1, 2, 3, 4 …” Soon I took over the counting, “14, 15, 16, see if you can get up to 20 …”</p>

<p>She got up to 20 and was puffing already, but I said, “Can you make it to 30?” Yep, no problem. And before I knew it, she was up to “80 … 90 …”</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bfhoyt/5722502739/"><img title="Running laps ... 80 ... 90 ... (click to view video)" src="/images/2011/05/video2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>I thought she might just make it to 100 (which would be about 700 metres, or close to half a mile). She did, and just kept going. “Run, Forrest, Run!”</p>
<p>I was amazed she made it through 150, up to 200, and then right up to 245 laps! She was pretty wasted, and I found myself saying, “You may stop if you like.” She said, “After I [puff] get a drink of [pant] water, then I’ll [puff pant] go again.” I explained about getting the stitch when you run with a tummy full of water, and she said, “Oh … I’ll have a rest.”</p>

<p>As mentioned, it’s about six metres between our bed and the couch — I’m guessing she ran over 1.5km that evening (about a mile).</p>
<p>So we have a runner on our hands — maybe she’s trying to <a href="http://www.rickandsusanna.com/2011/05/a-liddell-inheritance.html">keep up with her friend Micah!</a></p>

<p>I noticed that after she progressed to doing more laps she gave up her longer rests on the couch and bed between laps.   The rests must have wasted too much time!</p>
