<p>Most of you are probably aware that Hurricane Irene is currently moving up the East Coast of the States, and will most likely pass through, or very close to New York City. For those of you who are interested, we are not in an area likely to flood, and we don’t foresee needing to evacuate at all. We will quite likely lose power and/or water. August has been one of the wettest months on record for NYC for years, so with the soil already wet there is the danger of trees toppling in the high winds. The city’s entire public transport system has been shut down since noon today until Monday — the authorities seem to be taking this pretty seriously.</p>
<p>Right now it’s already raining quite hard, but there aren’t strong winds blowing yet — they’re likely to start later tonight. If you would like to track Irene’s path, <a href="http://crisislanding.appspot.com/">you can do that here.</a> The city’s entire public transport system has been shut down since noon today.</p>
<p>So, we’ve done what we can to prepare, and we’re just sitting this one out. Please keep the people in the path of this storm in your prayers. As I said, we’ll quite likely lose power (and with it Internet) so if you don’t hear from us for a day or two, don’t panic. We’ll get in touch as soon as we can!</p>

<p>Woah…I hadn’t seen that map before, that’s kinda cool.  Looks like Philadelphia won’t get hit too badly.  Praying that you guys stay safe.</p>

<p>We are praying for you! We’ve been watching the news from the New York Times and following the path of the hurricane. I hope it eases up before it hits New York, and that you don’t lose power. Love, Kelly and Phillipa</p>

<p>Praying for you, too! And, like Phillipa, following the New York Times. May God continue to grant grace so that you remain focused on Him!</p>
<p>PS: We thoroughly enjoyed having your parents over for lunch today, Franci.</p>
