<p>So you’re all dying to hear how we became chummy with the President, right? Well, it happened like this: we were walking outside the fence of his big fancy house, admiring the well kept garden and lawns, all lonesome and deserted when suddenly he jumped out of the bushes and shouted “BOO!”. It was like being back in childhood, becoming instantaneous friends with people at the playground.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know, this is just too far-fetched, isn’t it? :-) Okay, so we didn’t really become friends with the President. But we saw his house. And I saw his beehive. Promise — I’ll show you later.</p>
<p>So, as I mentioned last time, we drove from Lancaster County down to Rockville, MD, which is just outside of Washington D.C.  We stayed with a lovely couple whom Margaret met at the Janome conference in Orlando, Gary and Susan McLaughlin. You wouldn’t believe it but I forgot to take a photo of them! They were so kind and hospitable to virtual strangers (well, Margaret wasn’t a stranger, but the kids and I sure were!). They served us delicious food and we had some great conversations, and they were extra kind to the kids.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2999-large.jpg"><img title="Good food!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2999-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_3000-large.jpg"><img title="Good food" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_3000-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We enjoyed a visit to their quilt shop where even I finally succumbed and bought some fabric for a future quilt.</p>
<p>Or two.</p>
<p>Okay, three. But not <em>all</em> the fabric I’d need for all three!Okay, I’ll be quiet now.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2749-large.jpg"><img title="Susan and Margaret at Capital Quilts" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2749-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="379" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2753-large.jpg"><img title="Capital Quilts" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2753-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2754-large.jpg"><img title="Capital Quilts" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2754-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="432" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2757-large.jpg"><img title="Capital Quilts" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2757-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="367" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2758-large.jpg"><img title="Capital Quilts" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2758-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>After that we took the Metro into Washington D.C. to see the great sights of that city.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2759-large.jpg"><img title="On the Metro" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2759-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>What an empty (and clean!!) train!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2761-large.jpg"><img title="On an empty Metro!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2761-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We got off at the Capitol South station, which was close to the Capitol, duh.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2764-large.jpg"><img title="Capitol South Metro station" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2764-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Considering that the whole day was just about seeing a bunch of boring old big buildings and a lot of walking to the kids, they did incredibly well. One day they’ll wish they paid more attention.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty amazing seeing these famous buildings up close. The Capitol Building is really magnificent.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2772-large.jpg"><img title="The Capitol Building" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2772-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2790-large.jpg"><img title="The Capitol Building" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2790-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2802-large.jpg"><img title="The Capitol Building" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2802-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>There were guys with big guns all around. Don’t want to mess with them! And you gotta love all the black vehicles with tinted windows in the background!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2805-large.jpg"><img title="Big guns" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2805-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="441" /></a></p>
<p>The front of the Capitol.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2814-large.jpg"><img title="The Capitol Building (front)" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2814-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The view from Capitol Hill to the Washington memorial:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2811-large.jpg"><img title="Washington Memorial waaaay in the distance" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2811-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We saw the US Supreme Court Building too.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2799-large.jpg"><img title="Supreme Court" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2799-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>After seeing the Capitol, we walked on down “the mall”. Margaret was being a real tourist, taking pictures of squirrels!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2825-large.jpg"><img title="She takes photos of squirrels!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2825-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We came across a carousel and, though way overpriced, I took the kids on it. We had the whole thing to ourselves, which was fun.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2831-large.jpg"><img title="Carousel on the mall" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2831-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2834-large.jpg"><img title="Marica on the carousel" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2834-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2835-large.jpg"><img title="With Esther on the carousel" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2835-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Seeing that we had the whole thing to ourselves, I did a pretty impressive manouvre where I swung myself onto the moving horse next to Esther, and we galloped off into the sunset.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2843-large.jpg"><img title="I went on too" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2843-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>From there we walked on to the old Smithsonian castle, where we had lunch. For some strange reason I forgot to take photos of the food. Again. But it wasn’t exactly pretty — hot dogs with orange plastic cheese, things like that. An experience, but not a beautiful one.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2850-large.jpg"><img title="Smithsonian Castle" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2850-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2853-large.jpg"><img title="Smithsonian castle" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2853-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>After the Smithsonian Castle, we walked on over to the Smithsonian Museum of American History where we saw Julia Child’s Kitchen! It was a pilgrimage of sorts.</p>
<p>By this time we had done quite a lot of walking, and the kids were starting to look like this</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2869-large.jpg"><img title="Tired" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2869-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>and this</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2872-large.jpg"><img title="And grumpy" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2872-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>but thankfully they cheered up a bit, had a play with a couple of children’s displays at the museum, and were soon happy again. Here Marica’s doing a dance for us.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2876-large.jpg"><img title="Smithsonian museum of American history" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2876-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>A cool sculpture in front of the museum.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2881-large.jpg"><img title="Sculpture at the museum of american history" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2881-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="638" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2886-large.jpg"><img title="Julia Child's kitchen!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2886-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Am I allowed to be just a little bit envious of this collection? &lt;wistful sigh&gt; And this is only half of the collection — the other pots and pans are on one of the other walls.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2890-large.jpg"><img title="All women are equal, but some are more equal than others" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2890-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Her kitchen is about the size of half my apartment. I could get used to a kitchen that size! And with so much cupboard space! Goodness, I probably wouldn’t know what to do with so much space. I don’t think I’d have too much trouble filling it up, though!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2897-large.jpg"><img title="Her kitchen" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2897-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Hey man, that’s just way too much bench space for one woman. I’d be quite stoked with 3 ovens too. Just sayin’.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2898-large.jpg"><img title="Her kitchen" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2898-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Since I got <a href="/2010/08/07/my-new-book/">my copy</a> of <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>, I’ve made a number of dishes from it, all of them delicious. I hope to try more over the winter. I heartily recommend her Boeuf Bourguignon recipe. It calls for a whole bottle of red wine. Convinced yet?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2908-large.jpg"><img title="Julia Child" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2908-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>From the Museum we carried on to the White House, going past the Washington Memorial.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2923-large.jpg"><img title="The Washington Monument" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2923-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Margaret kindly gave Marica a piggyback, giving her a break from walking for quite some time.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2929-large.jpg"><img title="Piggyback from Aunty Margaret" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2929-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Hey look! Another old, big, important building!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2989-large.jpg"><img title="The treasury building" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2989-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The White House was pretty neat. This is its backside. Such a shame to have such beautiful big lawns and no kids running around on them.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2934-large.jpg"><img title="Big lawns" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2934-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2940-large.jpg"><img title="The White House" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2940-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And you thought I was joking about the beehive, didn’t you?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2942-large.jpg"><img title="The Presidential Beehive" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2942-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>You might think that the fence is not nearly high enough, but that would be because you’re not seeing all the security dudes.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2938-large.jpg"><img title="The fence" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2938-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2930-large.jpg"><img title="Secret Service!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2930-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>It’s a spectacular house in its own right, but knowing the history of its powerful inhabitants makes it seem even more stately. This is the front, which you probably knew already.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2970-large.jpg"><img title="The White House (front)" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2970-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Oh drat, we forgot our invitations at home!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2945-large.jpg"><img title="The gates" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2945-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I’m sure glad I don’t live in a house that people gawk at all the time!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2937-large.jpg"><img title="Gawkers" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2937-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And we, of course, were no better than them and got our pictures in front of the White House too. Notice how Marica’s yawning and Esther is absolutely passed out. What troopers!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2980-large.jpg"><img title="Margaret, Marica &amp; Esther in front of White House" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2980-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Marica wanted to do a curtsey in front of the Pwesident’s house.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2973-large.jpg"><img title="Marica doing a curtsey" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2973-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>And lastly, yours truly in front of the White House.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2986-large.jpg"><img title="Franci and Marica in front of the White House" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2986-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="415" /></a></p>
<p>Next time I’ll tell you about Baltimore and Philly, and I will sincerely aim not to have so many photos again. It’s just that you don’t visit the President’s town every day and all that, you know?</p>

<p>For more on children that really did run around on that presidential lawn, try “A Bully Father: Theodore Roosevelt’s Letters to His Children” (forward by David McCollough and biographical essay and notes by Joan Paterson Kerr).  It’s something else!  I’m just finishing it tonight and highly recommend it (if you can ignore his overuse of the word “cunning”).  Very easy read and very funny in parts.</p>
<p>Glad you had such a great [first part of your] trip!  Looking forward to hearing the rest.  And can’t wait for you to visit Knoxville—the sooner (and longer), the better.</p>

<p>Wow<br>
Hard to believe we did all of that in one Day.  Seems so long ago now.</p>

<p>Say, did you notice the ‘signature’ American fixture in the kitchen? - the dish rack left out on the bench, I mean counter.  I still leave mine out most of the time too.<br>

<p>I can’t say I noticed, because that’s ‘normal’ to me too — I grew up with it out on the bench too! Must be a Kiwi thing to put it away.</p>

<p>If you like Julia Child, I imagine you’ve seen some of her old TV shows online.  This one is a favourite in our house:  http://video.pbs.org/video/1166840087  “La Tarte Tatin” … see how her tart didn’t come out like it was supposed to. :)</p>
<p>Enjoying your trip reports.</p>

<p>Looks like a fabulous Big Day Out! Would love to visit Julia Child’s kitchen someday! And, just for the record, I don’t even own a dish rack. What does that make me?</p>

<p>That’s so neat that you saw Julia Child’s kitchen!  I need to see that sometime…I can’t imagine having that that cookware!</p>
