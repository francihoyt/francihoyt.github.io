<p>When Hannah and Eva were here, we went to the Met the same day we went to the Cloisters. The Met really deserves a day or two to itself, and I definitely plan to go back — the two or so hours we had there were only enough to see a few musical instruments and about 3/4 of the European Painters section.</p>
<p>I was very clever and snapped pictures without any added descriptions, and with a bunch of them I don’t even remember the artist! So bear with me as I show you ‘pretty paintings’ and some interesting musical instruments.</p>
<p>This painting shows Apollo getting ready for his daily trip around the world:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00545.jpg"><img title="Apollo starting the day" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00545.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>I forget the context, but the expressions in this one just cracks me up! (And just what exactly are those sneaky women up to?)</p>
<p><a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00545.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00544.jpg"><img title="This one cracks me up" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00544.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I got to see original works by Rembrandt van Rijn!<a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00544.jpg"></a></p>
<p><img title="Rembrandt van Rijn" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00514.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>Just look at the amazing detail of the lace in this Rembrandt:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00513.jpg"><img title="Amazing lace detail in Rembrandt" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00513.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And now onto some musical instruments, starting with the keyboards.</p>
<p>This, believe it or not, is a harpsichord. It even has a golden carseat on the back!</p>
<p><a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00540.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00539.jpg"><img title="Very fancy harpsichord" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00539.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And a fancy schmanchy piano:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00526.jpg"><img title="Pretty clavichord" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00526.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>Now for the strings:</p>
<p>Check out the cool curves on this 6-string violin (or is it a viola, or something else?):</p>
<p><a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00539.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00537.jpg"><img title="A cool viol" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00537.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>And did you know you used to be able to get pocket violins? Street performers would use them — so cute!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00540.jpg"><img title="Mini violins" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00540.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Don’t ask me how you’d play this harpo-lyre. Four arms, anyone?</p>
<p><a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00537.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00528.jpg"><img title="Interesting guitar" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00528.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>This horn was so beautifully painted, and the photo really doesn’t do it justice, but hey, you get an idea of what it was like! It almost looks a bit like Delft work.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2011/03/dsc00526.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00522.jpg"><img title="Beautiful Horn" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00522.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Ben and I hope to go back there some day and look at some more things in more detail — it’s such a big place, with such an amazing array of things!</p>

<p>The Rembrandt was about my favorite, Franci!</p>
<p>Wish I could go back with you for an extended tour.</p>

<p>Definitely going back there again.  And, yeah, how do you play the harpo-lyre?…don’t remember seeing it, but a very pertinent question.  Was hoping I could visit you again briefly in June when Eva flies to Vienna from Philidelphia, but I start a new job (!) Monday and doubt I’ll be able to take time off for a while.</p>
