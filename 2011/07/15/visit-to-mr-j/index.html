<p>A couple of weekends ago, we visited our good friend, Jeremy, in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0561.jpg"><img title="Jeremy" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0561.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>What a blast — we did some sight-seeing, but also my favourite pastime: having good discussions over good food.</p>
<p>There was of course also an appropriate amount of teasing which Jeremy thrived upon. (We have ample reason for this kind of fun because Jeremy is my daughter’s sister’s father’s youngest sister’s boyfriend.)</p>
<p>I took a heap of photos on this trip because I had just received my new camera, so you’re getting treated (or tortured, depending on your perspective) to a post with lots of photos!</p>
<p>Crossing into Philly:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0452.jpg"><img title="Driving into Philly" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0452.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Seeing the skyline as we enter the city:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0453.jpg"><img title="Philly skyline" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0453.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We drove past this church on our way to his house — I liked the lines of the building.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0460.jpg"><img title="A church we passed" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0460.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>What empty streets! So wide, and so <em>empty</em>! See my little cameo appearance?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0463.jpg"><img title="Empty street" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0463.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And here’s Jeremy’s street:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0464.jpg"><img title="Jeremy's Street" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0464.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>And the house where he lives:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0465.jpg"><img title="Jeremy's place" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0465.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>And the mammoth with whom he lives. The mammoth was drawn by one of his house mates and is called Woolworth. I thought you’d all benefit from knowing that.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0471.jpg"><img title="Woolworth" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0471.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy took us to see some of the historic parts of Philadelphia. We went to Penn’s landing where there was a big market and had lunch there.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0487.jpg"><img title="The Delaware river" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0487.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0495.jpg"><img title="Esther walking with Ben" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0495.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Don’t you think Jeremy looks good pushing a stroller? Awww, how sweet.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0494.jpg"><img title="Penn's landing" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0494.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>(Marica was a bit tired and sick that weekend, only for us to find out the next week that she had Strep. Oops.)</p>
<p>Manly talk while waiting for our sliders. (Sliders are small hamburgers.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0501.jpg"><img title="Buying food" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0501.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We saw Independence Hall (currently under construction).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0543.jpg"><img title="Independence Hall" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0543.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Nearby was a garden with a statue of The Signer (of the Declaration of Independence). I had a bit of editing fun turning it into a black and white picture — I like the silhouette effect that produced.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0530.jpg"><img title="The Signer" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0530.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>After lunch and a bit of wandering we had a rest on a lawn next to some other historic house (can you tell we’re not too into the details?) and Jeremy practiced sign language off a card that a deaf man gave me earlier. I had to catch him making an ‘L’, of course! :-)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0518.jpg"><img title="Jeremy signing an 'L'" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0518.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I reckon Ben is like a good wine — he just gets better every year he ages! Yes, indeed, I married him for his looks. (Among other things.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0522.jpg"><img title="Mr Handsome" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0522.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>THE FOOD for our dinner almost deserves a separate post to itself. We bought it at an indoor market (Reading Terminal Market) that sold pretty much everything you could think of — everything fresh and delicious. We got bratwurst there and some salad ingredients, as well as some sticky buns for our Sunday morning breakfast.</p>
<p>We had our yummy dinner outside in the backyard — the weather was pretty much perfect. The mosquitoes, not so much.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0597.jpg"><img title="J's backyard" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0597.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0580.jpg"><img title="Handsome father, cute kid" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0580.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Marica thought it was funny to pretend that she was drinking beer. We thought it was funny too.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0570.jpg"><img title="Marica pretending to drink some beer" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0570.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>A plate filled with goodness. Watch out for the claw of doom, it pounces when you least expect it!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0594.jpg"><img title="Dinner" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0594.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Grilled mushrooms with butter, garlic salt, pepper, parmesan and fresh mozzarella. And don’t forget the fresh basil. Oh yum.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0578.jpg"><img title="Barbecued mushrooms" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0578.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Salad of arugula, red pepper and fresh mozzarella. Simple. Hmmm.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0575.jpg"><img title="Salad" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0575.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>A little something out of Jeremy’s dad’s kitchen to burn the living daylights out of you.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0584.jpg"><img title="Jeremy's dad's HOT sauce" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0584.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0604.jpg"><img title="dinner outside" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0604.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The verdict:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0587.jpg"><img title="Jeremy enjoying dinner" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0587.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks for an awesome 30 (or so) hours, Jeremy! We had a great time. We’re looking forward to your (plural) visit in August!</p>

Oh, and Bevan says the food looks way to fancy. Take that as a compliment, Franci! :-)</p>
