<p>A few weekends ago we drove up to Connecticut to visit fellow Kiwis, Ron and Judy Snoek and their son Troy. They very kindly hosted us for a night with some good ol’ home-like hospitality. It was so nice to spend time with them and get to know them a bit better (I (Franci) hadn’t even met them before this!) and to hear the Kiwi accent again!</p>
<p>It was also nice to see a bit more of the States. There’s one thing I can say about Connecticut: it’s beautiful! So many trees!, so green!, so quaint! Though I’m sure I wouldn’t wax so lyrical about the trees if I lived there — the night before we arrived they had a very big storm that put out power to some houses in the vicinity and that knocked down many branches all over the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On Sunday we attended church with them. Their church meets in this beautiful <em>old</em> building. Legend has it that Jonathan Edwards even preached in this church!</p>

<p>The inside was so lovely — plain but beautiful.</p>

<p>And the organ, though I didn’t hear it played, was at least pretty to look at!</p>

<p>Here we are in front of the big church doors.</p>

<p>I managed to get a few shots of some of the old houses nearby. Some of them looked just like dolls’ houses!</p>

<p>Thanks again, Ron &amp; Judy, for the lovely weekend we could spend with you and for your generous hospitality! We look forward to a visit from you! :-)</p>
