<p>Snow is beautiful. And fun. It does get messy, and it keeps you indoors more than you’d like, but those are trifles compared to the six foot high piles of white-or-grey frozen stuff all over the streets. Quite something for us Kiwis.</p>
<p>Anyway, we thought we’d show you some recent photos. Remember, you can click any photo to see a bigger version.</p>
<p>Weird “snow hats” formed on the paintings hanging on our back-yard fence. This is after about 40 cm (15 in) of snow during a windless night (sorry about the “cropping” — that’s the bars outside our kitchen window):</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06744.jpg"><img title="Back-yard paintings with snow hats" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06744.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>What our footpath and street look like now. Those piles are about 1.5 m (5 ft) — it’s gotta go somewhere when people shovel it!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06766.jpg"><img title="What our footpath and street look like now" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06766.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Walking on the footpath can be interesting just after a snow. People are supposed to shovel in front of their own apartments, but some folks don’t get around to it:</p>

<p>Marica wading in it:</p>

<p>Franci and Marica’s snowman in our front “yard”:</p>

<p>One of New York City’s 2000 snow plows doing its thing:</p>

<p>Marica making a snow angel:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06779.jpg"><img title="Marica making a snow angel" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06779.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The result:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06783.jpg"><img title="Marica's snow angel" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06783.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The footpath is pretty well shovelled by now. Yep, those piles really are 1.5 times as tall as her:</p>

<p>Snow in the tree branches sure looks lovely. This recent snowfall was particularly nice, as there was very little wind:</p>

<p>That’s all, folks!</p>

<p>One of my first thoughts was, “Wow, wouldn’t that be nice—to have a snowman sitting on a pile of snow!”  (Instead of sitting in the middle of a huge grassy patch now bare of snow.  Such small amounts of snow also lead to snowmen being rather leafy, grassy, and or dirty from the very beginning.)</p>

<p>Those snow-covered trees with half the branch silhouetted in white are beautiful! - I like this photo best.  I just can’t quite grasp that this is the same place we baked in, just a few months ago.</p>

<p>I’m with you, Laurel. It boggles my mind to think that in just a few months our AC will be running non-stop and the thought of turning on my oven will be scary. And you know, when you guys were here it was already cooler than it had been in the summer!</p>
<p>I really don’t understand how the same place can get SO cold and SO hot!</p>
