<p>When Ben’s cousins, Hannah and Eva, were here visiting with us, the three of us took a trip up into Manhattan to see The Cloisters and The Met (The Met will be in another post!).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00419.jpg"><img title="The Cloisters" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00419.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Last time we visited The Cloisters, I was just recovering from my appendectomy and really not up to it, and I must say that I enjoyed it a whole lot more this time!</p>
<p>I got some nice window shots:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00489.jpg"><img title="Window" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00489.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00472.jpg"><img title="Another window" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00472.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>And a doorway:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00421.jpg"><img title="Doorway" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00421.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>In one of the chapels there was this intricately carved frieze:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00487.jpg"><img title="Frieze" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00487.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I enjoyed the pretty symmetry of pillars, of which there are <em>many</em> at The Cloisters:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00470.jpg"><img title="Columns" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00470.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Hannah sitting in an outside courtyard with some cool pillars behind her (she’s actually sitting by the pillars in the picture above.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00464.jpg"><img title="Hannah in courtyard" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00464.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Another courtyard, this time indoors:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00496.jpg"><img title="H&amp;E in an enclosed courtyard" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00496.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>We had pretty great weather — it was an unseasonably warm day, and we had some sandwiches outside.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00463.jpg"><img title="Having some lunch" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00463.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Having fun with reflections. We could say that Eva was reflecting on John the Baptist, who was in turn reflecting on how he lost his arm.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00457.jpg"><img title="Reflections on John the Baptist" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00457.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Hannah and Eva in front of a very detailed alabaster wall carving:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00452.jpg"><img title="In front of alabaster" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00452.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>There were plenty of statues, pictures, tapestries and carvings of Mary. Here are two I thought particularly pretty, though a tad condescending:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00450.jpg"><img title="Pretty Mary" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00450.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00425.jpg"><img title="Another pretty Mary" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00425.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Artists back in the day sure paid a lot of attention to detail! This little work below is not much bigger than a golf ball, and yet so incredibly detailed! The side panels can fold in or out and the whole thing can close. Sorry about the bad photo quality!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00433.jpg"><img title="Tiny detail" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00433.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>And just look at this beautifully painted book. I wish they still made them like this!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00429.jpg"><img title="Beautiful pages" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00429.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>There has to be some humor too, of course. In fact, I have a entire blog post dedicated to some of the humorous things we saw at The Cloisters coming to you in the next few days, but here is a little something to whet the appetite:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00439.jpg"><img title="Getting swallowed" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00439.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>With a description:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00440.jpg"><img title="Details" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00440.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
