<p>Now that’s a catchy title if I ever saw one!  :-)</p> <p>This past Saturday I took the train up to a little town called Irvington on the bank of the Hudson river where there was a huge homeschoolers debating tournament going on. I had volunteered to be a community judge when I heard about it, and all in all it was a neat experience.</p><p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00189.jpg"><img title="Irvington 1" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00189.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p><p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00188.jpg"><img title="Irvington 2" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00188.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p><p>(I didn’t see much of the town, so you’ll just have to be satisfied with pictures taken from the railway station!) Cute houses, eh?</p> <p>The train ride up there was quite pretty once we got out of the Bronx, but I think it would be even better in the summer and amazing in the fall. I really should take the whole family up there sometime…</p><p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00191.jpg"><img title="The Metro North (hudson line)" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00191.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p><p>I’m always surprised at the width of the Hudson!</p><p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00198.jpg"><img title="The wide Hudson" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00198.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p> <p>The debating tournament was very well organised, and I was very impressed with the quality of the young people’s speeches. I was a judge in one of the semi-final rounds and only judged 5 speeches, but it was sure hard to rank them because they were all very good! I was judging in the category where they could use visual aids and it was interesting to see how they creatively made use of materials (nothing electronic was allowed).</p> <p>This was only the local tournament. After this there is the regional tournament and then the national tournament. I was impressed with the quality at the local tournament, so I think the nationals must be something quite amazing! I’m looking forward to doing it again next year (hopefully!).</p>
