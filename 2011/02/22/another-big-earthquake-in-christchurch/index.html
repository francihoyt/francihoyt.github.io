<p><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake/4692170/Christchurch-quake-Cries-from-the-rubble">Yesterday a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck our hometown of Christchurch.</a> You might recall that Christchurch was hit by a 7.1 in September. The city has since felt thousands of aftershocks, of which yesterday’s 6.3 was one. It was very shallow and close to the city and has caused a lot more damage than the first big one. So far 65 people have been reported dead and there are many people trapped in rubble.</p>
<p>All our family members are safe. Everyone has some damage like things falling over and breaking, but Ben’s brother Bryan’s house has had foundation damage and broken windows. We’re not sure of the extent of damage to our house, but hope to find out later today.</p>
<p>We have not heard from many friends, so if you read this blog, please leave us a comment and let us know how you’re affected!</p>
<p>Please keep the people of Christchurch in your thoughts and prayers. It has been a nerve-wracking experience for most of them over the last few months, and yesterday’s shake will have made things worse for many. Pray for those who are injured, for those still trapped in the rubble, for those who have lost loved ones, for those working hard to help others, and for those in shock.</p>

<p>We just talked to Sally Davey and she said she thinks everyone in the church is OK. That is a relief! We are praying.</p>

<p>Hi Ben and Franci,<br>
we are all ok and have ‘escaped’ to Oamaru.</p>
<p>Still trying to adjust to what has happened.<br>
Words to describe what we feel like, fail.<br>
All I can say with confidence, is our God is a Gracious God.</p>
<p>We heard that power is now on at our place, so we’ll travel up for the day to start the clean up.<br>
Hope that your house is OK.</p>
