<p>I recently discovered Esther in the act of playing with her <a href="/2010/10/22/esthers-new-favourite-toy/">favourite toy</a> again. She was in her element, and had even put a washcloth and some bath toys in there too. She even washed herself with the washcloth, as you can see.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06618.jpg"><img title="Esther's favourite toy" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06618.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>Not only that, but the whole roll of toilet paper went in too. Doesn’t that expression just make you want to crack up?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06619.jpg"><img title="Uh-oh" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06619.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>By the way, the brown around Esther’s mouth was from food. Just for the record.</p>
<p>And yes, she got a bath!</p>
