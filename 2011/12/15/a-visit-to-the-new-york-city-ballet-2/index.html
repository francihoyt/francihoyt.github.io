<p>Last weekend our friend Megan, who dances in the <a href="http://www.nycballet.com/nycb/home/">New York City Ballet</a>, gave us two tickets to attend <em>The Nutcracker</em> ballet at the Lincoln Centre, and Ben took Marica to go watch her dance.</p>
<p>Marica was of course very excited to be able to go!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_4993-large.jpg"><img title="Marica in her seat" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_4993-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The company performs in the lovely David H. Koch theatre at the Lincoln Centre.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5021-large.jpg"><img title="David H. Koch theatre" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5021-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Ben said the dancing was really spectacular (and when the Christmas tree grew, it was gigantic — about 8 metres around at the base). You’re not allowed to take photos of the performance, but Megan invited them backstage after the performance.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5016-large.jpg"><img title="Impressive lighting" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5016-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Megan danced the part of “Coffee from Arabia” (a stunning solo dance set to almost haunting music that was very familiar, says Ben).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5000-large.jpg"><img title="Marica and Megan" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5000-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5004-large.jpg"><img title="Taking a look at the sleigh" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5004-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>They got to see the ‘snow’. Looking at this picture makes it look just like a <em>little</em> bucket full of paper pieces.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5010-large.jpg"><img title="Snow" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5010-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>But this photo shows you the size of it. And there were about 4 of them!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5014-large.jpg"><img title="Playing with 'snow'" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5014-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>They also got to see some of the other ballet dancers.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5008-large.jpg"><img title="Ballet dancer explaining something" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5008-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5009-large.jpg"><img title="More backstage" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5009-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I thought the photo above would look cool cropped and in B&amp;W, and here’s the result:</p>

<p>Another one of Megan with Marica.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Megan signed her ballet shoes and gave them to Marica as a momento of this very special day.</p>

<p>WOW!  We watched it last night (or most of it…Mom and I went out for a walk in the middle of it) and saw Megan’s performance.  And—wow—what an experience to go backstage and see all these people in person and get signed ballet shoes!!!  That will be a lasting memory, I hope.  So glad two of you got to take that in.  I’d gotten rather tired of the Nutcracker…too many indifferent Knoxville performances as a school child and too many piano recitals where we played pieces from the ballet—sometimes duets…but this renewed my interest in it.  The Sugar Plum Fairy was amazing!</p>

<p>So cooooool!  I love the signed ballet shoes.  I’ll have to tell the ballet instructor I accompany for about this.</p>

<p>On TV…PBS to be specific.  Every once in a while they feature shows “Live from Lincoln Center” with interviews with the cast during the intermission.</p>
