<p>Last week we had another bit of snow. (That was the snow before today’s snow, and Sunday’s snow, and then the two snows before that.) It seems every time Boston gets a foot or more of snow, we get about 2 or 3 inches. And I have to admit, I don’t mind one bit (sorry, Boston!). 2 or 3 inches is quite manageable, and fun to play in. However, this particular dumping was the most <em>beautifu</em><em>l </em>snow any of us had ever seen.  Normally, snow just seems to clump together into these big lumps, but this time you could see individual snowflakes stacked up to make the piles of snow. The sun would reflect off them, and you could see all their spectacular beauty. I tried taking some photos, but was really unsuccessful. Maybe these will give you a little idea of what it was like.</p>

Now, if you want to learn how to take photos of snowflakes, don’t ask me how! <a href="http://chaoticmind75.blogspot.com/2013/08/my-technique-for-snowflakes-shooting.html">But this guy… wow!</a> Scroll down the page to see some incredible specimens.</p>
<p>Even if my snowflake photography was a bit of a major flop, playing outside in the snow with the kids was not! This snow was light, fluffy, beautiful stuff to play in, and also really good for making snowballs!</p>

<p>Lovely! I’m glad you have opportunities to enjoy snow with your children (and yourselves), even though I know it can wear out after it start to melt and slush.</p>
