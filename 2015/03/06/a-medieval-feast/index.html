<p>Back in January, the homeschool co-op we attend put on a Medieval Feast. The organizers did a most spectacular job with the decorations, food and everything else that goes into organizing a big event like this. Most people came to co-op that day in costume, which made everything way more fun!</p>
<p>Entering the ‘castle’. Look, there’s even a moat!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0007.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0007.jpg" alt="DSC_0007" width="660" height="438" /></a>They transformed the gym into a royal medieval banquet hall, and it really looked the part. The photos don’t do it justice at all!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0009.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0009.jpg" alt="DSC_0009" width="660" height="438" /></a><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0014.jpg" alt="DSC_0014" width="660" height="438" />Most people contributed food, and it was all so tasty. They did this really neat thing where you used a pita bread for your plate. Then eventually, you’d sop up the juices of the meal with it and have some hummus too. My mouth is watering just remembering it all.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0012.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0012.jpg" alt="DSC_0012" width="660" height="438" /></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0017.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0017.jpg" alt="DSC_0017" width="660" height="438" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0013.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0013.jpg" alt="DSC_0013" width="660" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>They got some guys from a local fencing club in to tell us a bit about the sport. A couple of kids got to have a go, and I was just itching to have a go too and relive a bit of my past. I guess it is not exactly a well-known fact that I did fencing for two years in high school. I even took part in competitions… and failed miserably! :-)</p>

<p>Just look at this cake! (Much better than a real boar’s head, in my humble opinion.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/02/dsc_0015.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/02/dsc_0015.jpg" alt="DSC_0015" width="660" height="438" /></a></p>
<p>Here are the four of us in costume. Marica was adamant that she was not going to go as something <em>girly</em>. No, she went as “A pleasant (male) peasant.” Esther was very pleased with her princess costume, especially the hat — concocted in a hurry the night before — and I wore my Eowyn costume from Ben’s LOTR party back in August.</p>

<p>Where did you find your dress, Franci?</p>
<p>Looks like a very well-organized and executed event.  The boar’s head cake is amazing!</p>

<p>Beautiful photos/people. You caught some ‘mysterious’ faces on the girls where the expression of the eyes and mouth together speak volumes (but deciphering what they are speaking is a bit of an unknown). And I have to echo that you look lovely, Franci.<br>

<p>The whole event looks like spectacular fun! Brings back memories of our medieval feast two or three years ago … on a rather smaller scale.  We did discover that we rather like wassail!  And we thought it was fun, too, having bread for our plates.  In fact, any adventure which involves non-standard table manners is usually a hit.  :-)</p>
