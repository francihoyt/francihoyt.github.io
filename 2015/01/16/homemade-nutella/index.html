<p>I’ve always wanted to try making a version of Nutella at home, so recently I tried it. There are oodles of recipes online, and the one I tried is <a href="http://detoxinista.com/2014/09/homemade-nutella-dairy-free-refined-sugar-free/">from here</a>. It calls for coconut sugar, which I think is a bit of a fad food (not to mention <a href="http://www.tropicaltraditions.com/coconut_palm_sugar.htm">its sustainability is questionable</a>), so I used regular sugar and maple syrup. It is rather delicious, but quite different from regular Nutella. Ben reckons he likes it better because it has a slightly coarser texture. I’m sure you could mix it for ages and get it super smooth, but I tend to have a bad habit of trying to make things like this right at the same time as dinner, so I take short cuts.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it if you want to try it yourself.</p>
<p>Roast 1 1/2 cups of hazelnuts in a 300F oven for 20 minutes or so. Pour them into a tea towel and rub off as much of the skins as you can, then place them in a food processor.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Process the hazelnuts until you’ve made a hazelnut butter. Throw in a pinch of salt, 3 Tablespoons of cocoa powder, 1 Tablespoon melted coconut oil, 1/4 cup sugar, 3 Tablespoons maple syrup and 6 or so Tablespoons of water.</p>
<p>The first time I made this, I thought I could just cut out the sugar and water and use maple syrup instead. It did not work! It really needs the water for it to become glossy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2014/12/dsc_0127-large.jpg" alt="DSC_0127 (Large)" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>Whizz it all together until you have the glossiness and texture you want — play around with mixing it more or adding more water, cocoa or sugar to get the consistency and taste you want.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2014/12/dsc_0130-large.jpg" alt="DSC_0130 (Large)" width="640" height="425" /></p>
<p>And there you go. A really tasty yummy chocolate spread that took hardly any time to make.</p>

<p>(And yes, a teaspoon might be making its way into that jar more often than a knife…)</p>

<p>Maybe I’d like this version.  I think I liked Nutella only the first time or two, then it lost its appeal.</p>

<p>We only buy Nutella for a holiday treat … because of that teaspoon problem!  But I’ll share another recipe which I like almost as much, and some of the family better (and it’s cheaper!)</p>
<p>2 lb. butter, melted and slightly cooled<br>
375 g peanut butter (not sweetened)<br>
3/4 c. boiling water<br>
125 g cocoa powder<br>
1 kg icing sugar<br>
1 t. vanilla</p>
<p>Mix cocoa and icing sugar, then dissolve in hot water.  Add butter and beat till smooth.  Stir in peanut butter and vanilla.  Store in empty jam jars - it will solidify on cooling.</p>
