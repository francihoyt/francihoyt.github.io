<p>To you, commuter on the 6.15am bus<br>
who study on spinning wheels for an hour before a long day of work:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, mother of small children<br>
who have wiped more noses and bottoms and floors than you could count:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, wrinkled prayer warrior<br>
who sits in the recliner in the musty retirement home and talks to God:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, faithful writer of letters<br>
to people far and wide who seldom reply:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, pastor with the broad shoulders<br>
who carries the cares of stubborn sheep:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, teacher of difficult children<br>
who are learning only because you care:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, janitor of high school bathrooms<br>
who provides for your family with this second job:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, cubicle worker on the 56th floor<br>
who does the mundane with quiet joy:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, carer of the old or sick or frail<br>
who wonders how much longer you could possibly go on:<br>
Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
<p>To you, with the sleeves rolled up<br>
working hard<br>
where God has placed you<br>
at this point in time and space:<br>
Take courage, you work for Him.</p>
<p>He places importance in <em>how</em> you work.<br>
Be encouraged that your work makes a positive difference<br>
and that even if no-one else notices, He does.</p>
<p>Well done, good and faithful servant.</p>
