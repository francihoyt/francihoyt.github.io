<p>Most of you know that I (this is Ben posting for a change) run a little wedding gift registry website called <a href="https://giftyweddings.com/">GiftyWeddings.com</a>. It’s been going for almost eight years now, helping several couples every month create nice simple gift registries that aren’t tied to a particular store.</p>
<p>The design of the site was never exactly stellar (being designed by yours truly), but with bigger computer screens (and smaller phones!) it had started to look pretty dated:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/old-gifty1.png" alt="old-gifty.png" width="1347" height="681" /></p>
<p>I do like old-school, but … it was definitely time for an update.</p>
<p>So I’ve spent the last couple of months of bus commutes rebuilding the site: a new design, new implementation, new server, and new payment system. Here’s what it looks like now:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://giftyweddings.com"><img src="/images/2016/04/new-gifty.jpg" alt="new-gifty" width="1351" height="673" /></a></p>
<p>Complete with a fun photo of my wife going down a flying fox (zip-line) in her wedding dress.</p>
<p>So I’m a bit biased, but I think it’s an improvement. And the user interface is also significantly nicer, and works well on mobile phones — great for when your guests are out shopping for your wedding gift and want to cross an item off using their phone.</p>
<p>So if you know someone who’s getting married, please help our small, family-owned side business and point them to <strong><a href="https://giftyweddings.com">GiftyWeddings.com</a></strong>. :-)</p>
<p>If you’re of a nerdy bent and want to know what tools I used to build the new site, this list is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> for the backend (version 3.4)</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> running the server</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for the database</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee">peewee</a> ORM</li>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and JavaScript powering the frontend</li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payments</li>
</ul>
<p>I have good things to say about all those tools. React was new for me and a good experience. Stripe Checkout is an amazingly simple service to set up — highly recommended.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://giftyweddings.com/contact">contact me</a> if you have any feedback about the new site!</p>

<p>Looking forward to being one of the first to use the new site and send our guests here!  Thanks for all your work on it.  I’m heading over now to take a look!</p>

<p>Cool photo :-)<br>
I often mention this site in passing (although couples usually have chosen their gift registry before I get around to hearing about their plans).  But it is so easy to use compared the gift registries that involve lists from particular stores!</p>

<p>Nice to see the spruced up site. I enjoyed your inclusion of ‘tools’ you used, Benjamin.</p>
