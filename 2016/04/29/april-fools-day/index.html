<p>Our family, especially the kids, have taken a real liking to April 1st. The kids plan pranks for weeks in advance, which they then gleefully execute on the day. We also have a little tradition of having waffles for dinner on that night. It started off as dessert for dinner, but we adults had a hard time stomaching that, so we turned it into waffles (with sweet toppings, still!) for dinner. This year Ben and I had a little left-over chili before we had our waffles. We’re getting so old and boring!</p>
