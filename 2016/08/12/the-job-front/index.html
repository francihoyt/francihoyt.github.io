<p>In the last couple of months I’ve had a bit of a change job-wise (Franci said it was about time for me to write). I had been a software engineer for <a href="https://www.oyster.com/">Oyster.com</a> — now part of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a> — for just over six years, and decided it was time for a change and some new work experience while we’re here in the States.</p>
<p>So I started looking around, and interviewed with several companies: Google, <a href="https://www.paperlesspost.com/">Paperless Post</a>, and a couple of others. Google was interesting to interview with, but they said no (at least for the role I was looking for). So I was looking pretty hard at the Paperless offer, but then my boss offered me a new role within TripAdvisor working on a different team and with different technologies … and for various reasons, that’s the role I ended up taking. TripAdvisor is a really good company to work for.</p>
<p>The role is with <a href="https://www.jetsetter.com/">Jetsetter</a>, another sub-company of TripAdvisor, and it’s still software development, though I’m not managing a team anymore. Jetsetter, like Oyster, is a hotel review website, but they’re more focused on “travel inspiration” and at least traditionally a bit more of a luxury brand. I’m using different technologies (see below) and the team culture is somewhat different, but oddly enough I’m sitting only a few metres away from where I was before. So a substantial change, just not a geographical one. :-)</p>
<p>For the tech geeks among you: to date Jetsetter is mostly written in Scala and Node.js and React, and has a microservices approach on the backend. (In constrast, Oyster has an almost exclusively Python-based, monolithic backend.) I’m introducing some Python on the team with my first project, a new photo import system and image web server.</p>
<p>I’ve been with the new team for about a month now, and it’s been good so far!</p>
<p>In other news, I’ve signed up to teach a computer programming class at our homeschool co-op. It’ll be an hour every second Friday, starting in September, continuing for the full school year. I plan to do a few lessons on computing history and the basics of how computers work (binary, computer maths, what a programming language is), and then spend the rest of the year teaching basic programming skills while working on a project — a little computer game or website or some such. Franci will be sitting in on the class too, which is cool.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, and signing off for now!</p>
