<p><span style="line-height:1.5;"><img alt="Original Westminster Confession of Faith title page" src="/images/2013/11/westminster_confession_of_faith_title_page.jpg" class="portrait" width="255" height="374" />After hours of sweatless toil, I present to you the <a href="http://benhoyt.com/writings/pew/">Plain English Westminster</a>, or PEW if you like. It’s my “translation” of the Westminster Confession of Faith into modern English.</span></p>
<p>This is a project I’ve been working on for the last couple of years, very on and off. The writing is my work, though hats off to the OPC’s <a href="http://www.opc.org/documents/MESV.html">MESV</a>, and to Franci for her help with proofreading.</p>
<p>But why on earth do this? It started long ago in a galaxy far, far away. I’m a member of the <a href="http://rcnz.org.nz/">Reformed Churches of New Zealand</a>, and — oddly enough for a Reformed Church with roots in the Netherlands — the Westminster Confession is one of our church’s confessional documents. I was asked to (attempt to) teach it to a catechism class a few years back, but wading through 17th century formal English with 14-year-olds is tough going … and thus the PEW was born.</p>
<p>So without wasting any more ink here, you can read more about all that from the horse’s mouth over at my <a href="http://benhoyt.com/writings/pew/">Plain English Westminster</a> page.</p>
