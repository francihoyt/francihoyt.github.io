<p>I wasn’t, but Chuck Geschke was.</p>
<p>Let me back up a bit: for Christmas, Franci gave me a true geek book called <em>Masterminds of Programming</em>, which I <a href="http://blog.brush.co.nz/2013/01/masterminds-of-programming/">reviewed in detail here</a>. One of the interviews was with the creators of PostScript, a computer language used to control printers. PostScript was designed in 1984 and is still in widespread use today, especially because it shares a lot of concepts with the popular PDF file format.</p>

<p>I’d known about PostScript for a while, but what I didn’t know was that its creators went on to found and direct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems_Inc.">Adobe</a>. So I was reading the Wikipedia entry for one of the founders, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Geschke">Charles Geschke</a>, and was intrigued by the heading “1992 Kidnapping”.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when he was 52 he was kidnapped in broad daylight by two guys after “their share” of his wealth. The fascinating kidnapping story is recounted in a four-part tale in the <em>Los Altos Town Crier</em>.</p>
<p>Franci and I both enjoyed it — it’s quite a story! The story gets you into the intensity of the situation, and how his faith and family (particularly his “negotiator” daughter) helped him escape a very sticky situation. Links to the article below:</p>

<p>I read all the story about the kidnapping - as well as a little of your review - when I was catching up on things like your blog a couple of weeks ago.  It is quite thought-provoking to reflect on the long-term emotional and psychological effects on every day life of an experience like the kidnapping.  A parallel is what people must experience who are survivors of mass genocides or violent killings of family members.  Almost incomprehensible.</p>
