      <description>In an attempt to get up to date on here, I’m doing a ‘year in photos’, with a few glimpses into some of the highlights of the past year.
It’s one of those years I’m very thankful to see the end of.</description>

      <description>Laurelin at 2 weeks.
At 3 months.
At 7 months.
From the 2.2kg baby we brought home to a nice solid 7kg-ish almost-crawler. We’re so thankful for our happy, healthy, smiley Laurelin Grace!</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a written version of a pre-Christmas talk I gave at work recently, about the intersection between Christianity and hacker culture. There’s also a video available here — the sound quality’s not brilliant, but feel free to watch it there!</description>

      <description>Esther walked past my study this morning and said, “Dad, I see you in your office, but there’s nothing inside your pants!” Almost certainly thinking of this Dr Seuss book, here’s what she had seen:</description>

      <description>After hours of sweatless toil, I present to you the Plain English Westminster, or PEW if you like. It’s my “translation” of the Westminster Confession of Faith into modern English.
This is a project I’ve been working on for the last couple of years, very on and off.</description>

      <description>To catch up some of what we’ve been up to over the last year or so, I thought I’d just share some photos of life around here for the last few months of last year.</description>

      <description>It’s really happened! This is my last post of our roadtrip, only 16 months after the event. Shocking. Oh well, a beautiful baby girl has been added to our family since then and life’s been busy — that’s the way it is sometimes.</description>

      <description>We only had one day in San Francisco for sight-seeing, so naturally we didn’t see everything on the list, but we still saw a whole bunch of things!
We saw Alcatraz in the distance:</description>

      <description>Yo’s Mite. That’s how I always thought you pronounced Yosemite (having only ever seen it written). Now I know better. Just think Yo’s Cemetery without the ‘r’ and you’re set. :-)
One of the many things I love about the States is how varied the scenery is.</description>

      <description>I’m determined to finish the posts of our roadtrip, despite it now being almost exactly a year since we’ve been back in New Zealand.
After our stop in Lone Pine, we drove north to Yosemite National Park.</description>

      <description>I’m such a regular blogger, I have to tick the ‘Remember Me’ box every time I log in to the blog! I had high hopes of finishing the road trip blog posts before the baby arrived, but things got in the way (just minor things like a pregnancy, a hospital stay and the like)</description>

      <title>Roadtrip: Lone Pine</title>

      <description>The next stop couldn’t have been more different from Las Vegas. Tranquil, rural, isolated, pretty much nobody around, right in nature, and no electricity! We stayed the night in a little cabin/tent outside a small town called Lone Pine, between the Death Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</description>

      <title>Roadtrip: Las Vegas</title>

      <description>I know there are people who love Vegas. I find this difficult to understand because we didn’t enjoy it at all! It was like a sleazy version of Times Square, but it had good, cheap accommodation that was en route to our next destination.</description>

      <description>I wasn’t, but Chuck Geschke was.
Let me back up a bit: for Christmas, Franci gave me a true geek book called Masterminds of Programming, which I reviewed in detail here. One of the interviews was with the creators of PostScript, a computer language used to control printers.</description>

      <title>Continuing the roadtrip posts: A visit to Phoenix</title>

      <description>I know that I stopped our roadtrip posts rather abruptly last year, and for good reason, but I really do want to finish the posts before the baby arrives. That equates to six more posts over the next 3 months — surely I could do that?</description>
