      <description>There are times when certain things in life need to take a bit of a break, and this blog was one of them this past year. I’ve always enjoyed writing on here, but it had become just another thing I felt I had to do, and so I made the decision to just give it up for a while.</description>

      <description>Life’s been happening by the spade full around here, and blogging has been severely neglected, sorry. Here’s an attempt at rectifying that!
Back in July last year… hmmm, let’s see if the photos can remind me that far back!</description>

      <description>Marica has been taking photos of everyday beauty (mostly during our time in NZ), editing them, and has turned them into a nice little video, which I’d like to share with you below. Proud Mama moment!</description>

      <title>A little time travel into the past: June</title>

      <description>In early June, Marica and Esther performed and did really well at their annual piano recital. They both played solo pieces and also performed a duet. I was a proud mama!
The highlight of June was a visit from my sister Angelique and nephew Tyson.</description>

      <description>May brought an end to our homeschool co-op (but not to our schooling at home — that we continued until the end of June, much to the kids’ chagrin). We have a little tradition where our family takes a few friends out to a local chocolate shop where each of the kids (and moms) can choose a treat on the last day of co-op for the school year.</description>

      <description>In April, we had a wonderful visit from my parents. It was great to spend time together again — especially for the grandkids to have their grandparents around! Spring really was a great time for a visit — not too hot and not too cold, and it’s so beautiful with all the blossoms and flowers out.</description>

      <description>When Jana Kelly published Side by Side in 2015, I got the opportunity to review the book before it hit stores. It was great getting into the stories of Mia, Halimah, and Rania, and then to get deeper into their lives with the next book in the series, Door to Freedom.</description>

      <description>An update written by Ben for a change. After all, Franci has written almost all of the posts on this blog. As it happens, the last one Ben wrote was almost a year ago.
Ben is busy with various things.</description>

      <description>Back in February our 3 girls got to be flower girls for a lovely couple in our church, Kelvin and Joanna. It was a beautiful day — unseasonably warm for February basically the whole week leading up to the wedding.</description>

      <description>In February, Marica turned 10. TEN?? How does a decade go by so fast? Marica is growing up — both taller and also growing in maturity little by little. Or maybe not so little! Her independence in the kitchen is growing, and she’s becoming quite the cook and baker.</description>

      <description>In February we had a 1920’s festival at our homeschool co-op where we learned about some things that happened in the 1920’s in general, and in our area (Thomas Edison, who lived nearby, was actively inventing cool things; the Holland Tunnel between NJ and Manhattan was being built); we got to dress up in fun costumes, someone came in to teach us how to dance the Charleston, and we had a 1920’s themed feast.</description>

      <description>As the cruel parents we are, tonight we decided to make Marica grate – again:
Sorry, couldn’t resist.
But after I thought of the pun, I think there’s a serious point here, along the lines of that P.</description>

      <description>The year starts off differently here in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere. In some ways it doesn’t really feel like a new year — school and work just keeps going after a short break for Christmas; whereas in NZ just about nothing happens the first few weeks of January because 90% of the country is off somewhere on holiday.</description>

      <description>Advent is such a great time of the year. It’s filled with the anticipation of Christmas, warm kitchens overflowing with delicious smells, Christmas crafts, Christmas music playing in the background, parties, friends… (and it’s unfortunately also filled with busyness, usually mostly my own doing!</description>

      <description>Autumn this year was beautiful and mild and felt like a sort of nicer continuation of summer. We were, of course, back at doing school, but we tried to enjoy the nice weather as much as we could.</description>

      <description>(Though perhaps a better title would have been My Veggie Garden, but I’m generously including Ben because he heaved heavy compost bags and helped with digging and building a frame for my beans.)
I decided that this year I’d like to have a veggie garden again after not having one for three summers.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago, I really enjoyed reading through The Greatest Gift by Ann Voskamp for Advent. This year I’m trying to be organized enough to remind you that if this is something you’d like to buy, now’s a good time, with Advent being just two weeks away and all!</description>

      <description>I built a cake earlier this week. I’m doing really well at blogging about it while the cake is still in existence on the kitchen counter! I’m still playing catch-up with blogging about news from the summer, but I wanted to share this before it died in my drafts folder like so many other recipes.</description>

      <description>For the last leg of our roadtrip home, we made a stop at Six Flags in the south of New Jersey. They have a program called Read To Succeed where the kids have to read a total of 600 hours in the year to get free tickets to Six Flags.</description>

      <description>After our stint in Charleston, we had a long but beautiful drive up to Chincoteague, VA. Our reason for visiting was because we had recently listened to Misty of Chincoteague on audio and loved the story, and seeing that it was sort of on our way home, thought it would be cool to stop and see the area.</description>

      <description>It was with heavy hearts that we said our goodbyes after the Hoyt reunion, but it was time to start making our way home. Because Ben was in between jobs at that point, he could take off some extra time and we decided to take the trip back up a little more slowly to stop at a few places we were interested in.</description>

      <description>After our visit to Monticello we started the drive down to Cherokee National Forest in east Tennessee where we planned on camping for a couple of nights. We started off in the rain and the rain just got heavier and heavier, and there were predictions for a huge storm to pass over where we were going to camp that night.</description>

      <description>This year was the happy year where a US Hoyt reunion took place. This time was again in Georgia, so back in June we took a two and a half week long roadtrip down south. It worked out well that Ben happened to be between jobs at that point so he took 3 weeks off, which was so great.</description>

Laurelin is now a full-blown 3-year-old and no push-over, in every sense of the word.</description>

I had been a software engineer for Oyster.com — now part of TripAdvisor — for just over six years, and decided it was time for a change and some new work experience while we’re here in the States.</description>

      <description>I’m playing catch-up here on the blog after my long silence. We start back at school in 3 weeks or so, but it feels as though we’ve hardly started vacation. Summer for us here in the US seems to be filled with more activity than during the school year.</description>

      <description>The last couple of months have looked a little different to our usual routines. I’ve had a relapse of the Epstein-Barr virus which wiped me out but I seem to be feeling a fair bit better the last week or so; Ben’s been looking at different job options and has had multiple interviews with several different companies (no decision yet, though).</description>

I teach a Narnia literature class at our homeschool co-op, which has been really fun. For me, anyway. Not quite sure what the kids think, seeing that it’s a discussion class and I make them talk.</description>

      <description>In our living room stands a beautiful wooden display cabinet that has been in my family for 3 generations. It displays a selection of pretty tea cups, teapots, milk pitchers and sugar pots I have been given from my grandma, my mum, and Ben’s grandma Tschetter.</description>

      <description>This year’s Easter was a busy but lovely one. We kept up the tradition of making hot cross buns and egg dying, which the kids always love,
&amp;nbsp;
and on Easter Sunday we hosted a large crowd of church folk for a yummy dinner, followed by some rousing hymn singing.</description>

      <description>Our family, especially the kids, have taken a real liking to April 1st. The kids plan pranks for weeks in advance, which they then gleefully execute on the day. We also have a little tradition of having waffles for dinner on that night.</description>

      <description>For the first few years of our marriage Ben and I had a little dog, Blitzie. When we came to the States in 2010, we gave her away and she’s been living happily every after on a pig farm since.</description>

      <description>It’s been quiet on here for a while. When that happens, it usually means things around here have been a little extra busy, which it indeed has. Some of the highlights of the busyness will be following in the next few weeks, but before the warm weather completely overtakes us I wanted to share some last winter snow pictures.</description>

      <description>Most of you know that I (this is Ben posting for a change) run a little wedding gift registry website called GiftyWeddings.com. It’s been going for almost eight years now, helping several couples every month create nice simple gift registries that aren’t tied to a particular store.</description>

      <description>My oldest turned 9 last month. Where did the time go? I know all mothers always say that, but my oh my, they grow up fast. Gone is the little girl who liked her hair braided all pretty, and who would wear whatever her mother put out for her.</description>

      <description>I feel like I’m always putting up stuff on here that’s a month or more old. It just seems to be the rate at which I can keep up with things! A few days after we got back from New Zealand mid-January, we had the first big (and the only big, really) snow storm of the winter.</description>

      <description>A couple of days after Christmas Ben returned to the US, and the girls and I stayed in NZ for another 3 (full, but great) weeks. We met up with lots of family and friends and had such a great time that for the most part I forgot to take my camera along.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was a little nippy. I’d say it was the coldest weather we’ve ever experienced! Most of last week the high during the day didn’t get above 0°C, and by Sunday morning we woke up to this (my phone shows temperature in Celsius):</description>

      <description>I know this isn’t technically part of our trip to New Zealand, but I didn’t really want to make a whole separate post for these photos I took before we left. December was unseasonably warm, so one evening while Ben worked late, I took the kids on a post-dinner walk around the neighborhood to enjoy the lights on people’s houses.</description>

      <description>A couple of days after we arrived, we headed out of town to Mt Hutt in the Southern Alps for a Hoyt reunion. I think it had been the first time in almost 6 years that everyone were together again — Mum &amp;amp; Dad, all 8 siblings, plus spouses and kids — and it was fantastic.</description>

      <description>How do you describe a place? I can tell you about beautiful green rolling hills, changeable weather, children walking barefoot down the road without anyone scowling at them. I can tell you about the lilt of an accent, of driving on the left side of the road, of great coffee — both instant and barista made.</description>

For those of you who might be interested, here are the recipes of what we made.</description>

      <description>On a lovely warm day back in October, the girls and I took a field trip to a farm about an hour’s drive from where we live to go apple and pumpkin picking. The weather was fantastic — it was nice and sunny and not too hot or cold, a real Goldilocks kind of day.</description>

      <description>I have a love-hate relationship with autumn. I love all the beautiful colors, the cooler weather and the fun things the season brings like apples, cinnamon, pumpkin pie and hot chocolate. But… autumn is the start of a long cold spell that only keeps getting worse for about 5 months before it starts getting better!</description>

It’s great to have the routines of school, but it does leave very little time for extra things, like blogging and other fun stuff.</description>

In July, we hosted the Holtslags, our pastor from NZ and his family, as well as James and Laura (James is Phillipa’s son, Laura is the Holtslags’ daughter). This time we sent them off to do sight-seeing by themselves, but we still got to have some good conversations over the weekend.</description>

We’ve had playdates, we’ve played in the sprinklers, we’ve done lots of swimming, we’ve had sleep-overs, we’ve had visits to the library, we’ve had a couple of road trips, we’ve had homemade lemonade, iced tea and popsicles, eaten tonnes of watermelon and peaches and corn… you know… summer stuff.</description>

      <description>I thought it’s about time I showed you a photo of our new place. We moved in Memorial Day (with the help of some amazing and hard-working friends), and have managed to unpack all the boxes.</description>

      <description>I’m so glad to have been given the opportunity to review the book Side by Side by Jana Kelley. I met Jana back in 2004 when I spent half a year working in Sudan. Although Jana was not a part of the team I was working with, our paths crossed fairly regularly: we taught a conversational English class together at a tea house for women; and I taught and helped out at the school where her boys attended.</description>

March was heralded in by a snowstorm, and it looked like this in front of our house just a couple of weeks ago:</description>

      <description>Marica turned 8 in February. It’s been so fun to see her grow up a bit more over the last year! I’ve especially enjoyed seeing her sense of humor develop a bit more (starting to understand and appreciate puns and subtleties), and to see her get a little bit more mature and responsible.</description>

      <description>I’ve always wanted to try making a version of Nutella at home, so recently I tried it. There are oodles of recipes online, and the one I tried is from here. It calls for coconut sugar, which I think is a bit of a fad food (not to mention its sustainability is questionable), so I used regular sugar and maple syrup.</description>

So, for that reason, and because there’s cooking to be done, I’ll keep this short and leave you with the lyrics of a hymn whose tune I dislike, but that has powerful words.</description>

      <description>With such a sensationalist title, you’d think this is something really special, right? Well, not quite! TripAdvisor (where Ben works) had this internal competition over the summer where you could send in a photo with a TripAdvisor fridge magnet on your vehicle, and every week they picked a winner.</description>

you have a sweet face,
I love your squishy fatness
to cuddle and to kiss,
But what makes me fondly stare
is your light, unruly hair!</description>

      <description>I was folding washing this morning listening to Marica and Esther talk, and just had to share this funny:
E: “Mawica, dose are nithe octoputheth.”
M: “They aren’t octopuses, they’re decorations!
E: “Dey look like octoputheth…”</description>

      <description>On the first weekend of July we took the kids to the Meadowlands State Fair which is pretty close to where we live. The kids were giddy with excitement!
We got there as soon as it opened in the afternoon so it wouldn’t be too busy, and that was a good idea because there weren’t many lines to wait in, but everything got progressively busier during the late afternoon.</description>

      <description>Laurelin Grace, our youngest, turned one recently. The first year of her life has been an eventful one for our family. She was born 3 weeks early, induced in a bit of a rush. For the first 5 weeks of her life, she nursed every 2 hours or less and developed strong lungs from all her colic-induced crying.</description>

Ben took the morning off so that we could go to the MVC to get our New Jersey driver’s licences, but the unfortunately the proof of address we took along was not good enough in their books, so we had to leave without the licences.</description>

      <description>Last night I was sitting down and my mind thought up a riddle all by itself. It’s useful like that. See if you can figure it out:
What can see light but has never seen the sun;</description>

      <description>We started this blog almost four years ago with the words “so we’re going overseas in a month”. They do say history repeats itself…
About six months ago, Ben got a job offer with TripAdvisor who was hoping to acquire Oyster.</description>

It’s one of those years I’m very thankful to see the end of.</description>

      <description>It’s really happened! This is my last post of our roadtrip, only 16 months after the event. Shocking. Oh well, a beautiful baby girl has been added to our family since then and life’s been busy — that’s the way it is sometimes.</description>

      <description>Yo’s Mite. That’s how I always thought you pronounced Yosemite (having only ever seen it written). Now I know better. Just think Yo’s Cemetery without the ‘r’ and you’re set. :-)
One of the many things I love about the States is how varied the scenery is.</description>

      <description>The next stop couldn’t have been more different from Las Vegas. Tranquil, rural, isolated, pretty much nobody around, right in nature, and no electricity! We stayed the night in a little cabin/tent outside a small town called Lone Pine, between the Death Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</description>

      <description>I know there are people who love Vegas. I find this difficult to understand because we didn’t enjoy it at all! It was like a sleazy version of Times Square, but it had good, cheap accommodation that was en route to our next destination.</description>

      <description>Those of you who have been following the blog for any time over the last 2.5 years or so will have noticed that there has been a marked drop in the frequency of posts here. The reason for that has partly been that coming back to New Zealand has made life busier in many ways and that the time to blog has diminished.</description>

Call me thick, but I only just realised after reading wikipedia that the cliff dwellings are not original, but instead have been relocated to their current location.</description>

The total number of photos taken on our roadtrip so far were well over a thousand and I was doing well keeping up to date with deleting the bad ones, editing the ones that needed a bit of lightening or the like, even if I haven’t been the greatest at updating the blog.</description>

      <description>We spent 10 nights in Knoxville with Ben’s Uncle Ron and Aunt Marti, and his cousins Hannah and Eva.
This happened already well over two weeks ago, and I’m only now getting around to telling y’all about it (can you tell I’m in the south?</description>

Consider this a teaser until I get a post up with the rest of our photos from our time in Knoxville.</description>

      <description>After our first stop in Connecticut with the Snoeks, we headed down to Philadelphia where we stayed with Lillian and Jeremy and visited with several friends over the course of the weekend.
On the way to Lillian and Jeremy we stopped and Sam and Emily Perez’s home, friends from our church in New York.</description>

      <description>We had a rather stressful start to our roadtrip. I was overly optimistic (or foolish?) and hoped that everything might just fit into 6 suitcases plus a bunch of little bits and pieces. My reasoning for this was that I couldn’t see us parting with much more — I only kept the things I really wanted to and had gotten rid of more than felt comfortable.</description>

      <description>New York…
Your name invoked images, awe, presumptions
of ghetto, gangster, glamour, glitz.
Yet many will be surprised to know
I found in you much goodness and grace
just as ingrained
as the grit and grime.</description>

We joked with the kids that the man was trying to push over the tree, and do they want to go and help him?</description>

      <description>I think the Pennsylvanian countryside is just so beautiful. It seems very peaceful to me, perhaps because I’m usually on holiday when I’m there.
When we took Lizel there when she visited, Marica stayed with dear friends who took her to a ballet concert, so Esther got to be the only child for a weekend.</description>

      <description>In March, my friend Lizel visited us from South Africa.
Lizel and I have been close friends since we were seven years old, despite living apart for 15 of those. As kids, we would do all sorts of crazy things like pelt the neighbour’s house with mud cookies, or knock on people’s doors and run away, or take whoopie cushions into shops and walk through the aisles making farting noises.</description>

      <description>I recently had the fun experience of going to a book signing. It was fun, because I got to head out by myself for an evening, and fun because I got to meet someone semi-famous. I say semi-famous because if you don’t frequent food blogs or watch food shows on TV, you’ve probably never heard of The Pioneer Woman.</description>

      <description>My friend Matthew Bartlett recently started his own publishing company, and his first book is The Biblical Mandate for Caring for Creation by retired New Zealand minister Dick Tripp. The 158-page book, which can be yours for a mere $24.</description>

      <description>I was going to start by saying that Esther turned two just last week. But then I realised that it would almost be more accurate to say she turned two just last month. Sometimes I feel disoriented with how fast time goes — my head is still two weeks ago and my body, by default, is here and now.</description>

      <description>Well, Thanksgiving came and went, and we had a lovely day. It was great to have a bonus day where Ben had the day off, and we enjoyed getting to know a friend from church a bit better.</description>

      <title>Is Christianity sexist?</title>

      <description>Perhaps the most-prayed Christian prayer is the Lord’s Prayer: “Our Father who art in heaven…” But why Father and not person or parent? Is Christianity sexist?
Our home church denomination recently held a national Synod meeting, and one of the things they discussed was the updated 2011 translation of the NIV Bible.</description>

      <description>After our 3 nights in the Adirondack mountains, we drove to Niagara Falls. The scenery on the way was beautiful!
Crossing the border into Canada.
We arrived on a cold, windy, overcast afternoon, but didn’t know whether the weather would clear up over the weekend, so decided to brave it and go look at the falls regardless.</description>

      <description>For most of the month of October we had my parents visiting with us, and we had a very good time together.
The highlight of their time here was probably our road trip that we took to the Adirondack mountains, Niagara Falls, Toronto and Pennsylvania to visit our friends the Tysons and the Braunings.</description>

      <description>Every time I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art I see something I haven’t seen before, and I certainly go back to old favourites. Recently I took some photos with a hairy theme. Some of them are so ridiculous, you’d have to be an old stodge not to even get a slight smile at the lips.</description>

      <description>I don’t really care for modern art much, so I’ve never felt a deep desire to go look at what’s inside the Guggenheim museum (I can get my fill at the Met by glimpsing at the modern art section when I walk past there to get to the European sculptures).</description>

      <description>“Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me?” Ps 43:5
That’s what this sculpture by Aristide Maillol brought to mind when I saw it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The artist did an amazing job — it was as if everything about her just felt so sad.</description>

I happened to take this picture of a city centre sculpture and when I went through the photos afterwards I saw how perfectly (total fluke) the moon was aligned with this thing.</description>

      <description>We left Washington D.C. on a Friday afternoon and drove up to Baltimore. I’m not sure if we saw the wrong side of Baltimore or what, but neither of us were particularly impressed. I guess that wasn’t helped by a fire drill going on at the Art Museum as soon as we walked in, and nobody knowing what was going on, including the staff, which meant we just walked straight back out!</description>

      <description>Now that you all know that Lillian and Jeremy are engaged, we can all happily say “Hooray!”. Lillian was here for a very short visit (just under 2 weeks) and flew into JFK, so we got the privilege of hosting the two of them for a few nights before they went off to Philadelphia to go get engaged.</description>

      <description>But that makes it sound like it’s a bad thing when it is indeed a very happy thing — the last of 8 children getting married. Yes, that’s right, Ben’s little sister, Lillian, is engaged to be married to a certain Mr Jeremy Fisher, uh, I mean Mr Jeremy L Eshelman!</description>

      <description>We’re posting this from a rescue boat (with free wireless internet) that lifted us from the roof of our flooded apartment early this morning. We’re sipping complimentary cocktails as we traverse the streets by boat, witnessing how New York has turned into a lake full of broken branches and leaves, a veritable Venice.</description>

      <description>Most of you are probably aware that Hurricane Irene is currently moving up the East Coast of the States, and will most likely pass through, or very close to New York City. For those of you who are interested, we are not in an area likely to flood, and we don’t foresee needing to evacuate at all.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about all sorts of matters relating to the heart — it’s interesting that we describe both things emotional and spiritual with the metaphor of the heart. “His heart is not in the right place”, “she’s lost heart”, “guard your heart”.</description>

      <description>The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky is a classic, or so I’ve heard. It’s one of those books so great and so worth reading that no one you talk to has actually read it.
A 700-page novel is something of a commitment, but I approached this one with an open mind and a daily subway commute.</description>

What a blast — we did some sight-seeing, but also my favourite pastime: having good discussions over good food.
There was of course also an appropriate amount of teasing which Jeremy thrived upon.</description>

      <description>Blueberries are in season now here in the States and they’re plentiful and cheap. They’re also ridiculously good for you, but that’s really beside the point — what matters is that they taste so good! It’s hard to believe that they can taste better in any way other than plain from the punnet, but these pancakes bring out the blueberry flavour very well and they melt in your mouth.</description>

      <description>Well, she certainly is. And she’s fast too. She’s loving the new independence and so am I. Playgrounds are much more fun, despite the scratched knees she inevitably gets!
Walking down Fulton Street. That big tower in the background under construction is the new One World Trade Center.</description>

      <description>How is it possible that we have been in New York City for a year already? Yes, everyone, it’s been a YEAR! When we arrived a year ago, I must admit that I viewed our ‘adventure’ with some trepidation.</description>

      <description>When Ben’s dad was here back in April we got a fair bit of sight-seeing done, which even included some things I hadn’t seen or done before, which was pretty exciting. One of those things was walking the Brooklyn Bridge, which is just one of those things you have to do in New York City.</description>

      <description>I’ve been thinking about my job (as a mother) a fair bit recently. After Monday’s blog post, I felt that I might have given the wrong impression of what life around here looks like. I have a policy (with myself) not to complain or whine on this blog — not about big city life and not about my family.</description>

      <description>Marica said I looked beautiful after she was finished making me beautiful. Ben came home and called me hideous. I’ll let you decide for yourself!
It was cold and rainy a fair bit back in March, so one day when Marica asked if she could make me pretty, I consented.</description>

Christmas with snow, Easter with blossoms, summer holiday that doesn’t mix with Christmas. Celebrating Christmas here was great in that sense, and Easter is looking promising too.</description>

      <description>When Hannah and Eva were here, we went to the Met the same day we went to the Cloisters. The Met really deserves a day or two to itself, and I definitely plan to go back — the two or so hours we had there were only enough to see a few musical instruments and about 3/4 of the European Painters section.</description>

My apologies go to the artists who did not create their masterpieces for us to laugh at, and to those of you who find Roman Catholic artefacts more meaningful than un-cultured moi.</description>

Though perhaps that’s not a good way for me to look at it — it would be better to think about being blessed with another year instead of having a hum-ho attitude of ‘oh, just another year’.</description>

      <description>That’s how it feels to me sometimes when I realise that all my scheduled posts have run out, and my drafts folder is looking a bit emaciated. We run this blog mainly to stay in contact with family and friends back home in New Zealand to share what we’ve been up to, what we’re thinking about and stuff we like.</description>

      <description>There are times in life when we get overwhelmed. Sometimes we have too much work to do, sometimes we’re ill, sometimes we’re just dog tired, sometimes earthquakes strike. The world keeps spinning, life carries on and we have to somehow deal with it.</description>

      <description>Yesterday a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck our hometown of Christchurch. You might recall that Christchurch was hit by a 7.1 in September. The city has since felt thousands of aftershocks, of which yesterday’s 6.3 was one.</description>

      <description>This past weekend Ben and I flew off into the Tropical sunset and had a total blast. We came back on Monday night and since then we’ve been right back into things here. I wasn’t organised enough to have self-publishing posts past Monday’s post on here, and things have been busy since we’ve been back, so you’ll all have to wait a little while till Friday to hear all about our trip and see a whole bunch of photos.</description>

Alice’s Tea Cup is definitely a girly tea room, decorated in pretty colours with cool chandeliers and fairy wings on the walls.</description>

      <description>I often feel slightly frustrated at the seeming lack of time I have for doing things like reading, crafting or doing special fun things with the kids. Part of my lack of time is certainly due to the demands of daily life as a wife and a stay-at-home mother of two busy little people, but some of it is most certainly due to me wasting time.</description>

Life with Ben has been like a beautiful dance, a dance he leads to help us move forward as one. There has been the odd difficult patch because we are living life in a fallen world, after all, but on the whole it has been six years that God has packed with blessing upon blessing.</description>

      <description>Some of you have no doubt heard of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, or “The Met”, here in New York City. It’s a massive museum of art and culture, along Museum Mile on the east side of Central Park.</description>

      <description>I thought I’d share a few photos of our time with the Braunings. We were so blessed by their hospitality, company, conversation and great food. Thanks again for inviting us, Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Brauning, and putting up with our changed plans and an invalid!</description>

      <description>It all started on an adventurous Saturday, almost 2 weeks ago. I was excited and a little scared because I was going to be making my biggest driving trip yet — a half an hour drive to our pastor’s house in the south of Brooklyn for a ladies’ Bible study.</description>

      <description>I’m just now home from a second trip to the hospital and feeling much better than last week! After getting home last week I couldn’t keep food down and felt dizzy all the time. We made a kind of last-minute decision to go to the Braunings after all and spent Friday night with them.</description>

      <description>Just thought I’d let everyone know that we’re taking a little blogging holiday over the Thanksgiving break. We’ll be back next week!
I’m also then going to a 3-day a week blogging schedule. I’m finding it a bit difficult to keep up with the demands of a household with 2 small children as well as rolling out a blog post per day.</description>

      <description>We got the tummy bug over the weekend — fun for the whole family! But Franci’s “bug” hung around, and then got more and more painful. Turns out she has acute appendicitis. They’re going to cut her open tonight (might as well not “mince” words) and remove her appendix.</description>

A life that is full of thanksgiving is a happy one, no matter what the circumstances, and what can be better than once a year celebrating the good things God has given us with a great big feast?</description>

      <description>Just a little heads-up to our readers that this post is dealing with the topic of Christian contentment and is therefore explicitly religious. :-)
Today I’m delving into something totally different. This post won’t have many photos, and it won’t be about what we’ve been up to.</description>

      <description>Last week we were all a bit under the weather, but of course when kids are sick they are still full of ideas and energy. So one morning after finishing off a box of cereal, I remembered doing crafts with cereal boxes as a kid and looked online for something to do with the cereal box.</description>

      <description>The other day Franci and I were talking about subjects we studied in high school, and Marica asked what “calculus” was. Franci said it was a type of maths (Marica’s been learning her written numbers). Marica of course replied that “she could do that”, but Franci said she was probably a bit young for calculus.</description>

Ben has only had a couple of days where he didn’t feel too great, and Marica’s only had a bit of a runny nose, but Esther’s gotten hit the hardest.</description>

      <description>Last weekend we visited Ben’s uncle Sherwood and aunt Sharon in Pottstown, near Philadelphia. It was a very nice restful weekend, just visiting and getting to know them a bit better. Their daughter, Esther, is away at college, but Jonathan was there and the kids loved playing with him — he’s really good with children.</description>

      <description>Macadamia nuts are my absolutely no-doubt-about-it favourite nut! They also seem to be about the most expensive, though. However, I recently discovered that we have an organic grocer nearby and they have bulk bins (unlike the supermarket) and their nuts and pretty much everything else are very well priced.</description>

      <description>Last night I had an audition for the Brooklyn Conservatory Chorale. I’ve been thinking for a while that I’d like to do some music again, but because we don’t have a piano and I decided not to bring my violin, it has to be singing which I thankfully enjoy doing very much!</description>

      <description>While Christchurch is still having earthquakes, here in Brooklyn we had our very own tornado (or super-severe storm — the weather service isn’t sure which). The winds and rain whipped up all of a sudden, picked up huge branches and even trees and threw them across the streets, and then twenty minutes later it was dead calm again.</description>

      <description>The last week of July we headed off to Colorado for a Tschetter family reunion (Ben’s mum’s side of the family) to specially celebrate Ben’s grandparents’ 70th wedding anniversary. We flew to Denver and then Mum and Dad Hoyt picked us up from the airport and we drove into the mountains.</description>

      <description>I’ve you’re an avid follower of our blog, you will have noticed that our posts have been rather sparse the last 2 and a half weeks. We’ve had a great time away traipsing over the country visiting family.</description>

      <description>My lovely husband has recently bought me Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking. I have read the preface and all the introductory remarks. Now I need to start cooking from it. It’s just been so hot that cooking anything that isn’t a hamburger patty is not very appealing, even if it is French.</description>

      <description>As most of you know, I’m now working for Oyster.com in New York City. Oyster is a small (15 staff) startup company that runs a website which lets you review and book hotels. Apart from offering good rates, one of the main things that sets Oyster apart is its thorough reviews and top-quality photos, allowing customers to really see what they’re getting before they book.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month, on the 4th of July, the United States of America celebrated Independence Day. It’s been 234 years since America declared independence from Great Britain, and for the average American England is now just some far away place where people talk funny.</description>

      <description>We visited the New York Aquarium in Coney Island recently. From where we were at our old place in Brooklyn, it’s about an hour on the subway to get there.
There’s a great board walk with lots of shops selling food and trinkets.</description>

So we moved into our new place last Thursday, and let me tell you, it has been a full week.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, Lord willing, we move into our apartment. While this is great, it does however mean that we will be without internet access for a week. Actually, I’ll be without internet access for a week because Ben will still be able to check email and stuff at work.</description>

      <description>On Saturday, after our little jaunt to Staten Island, we had a little meander around Wall Street. When dad Hoyt talks about Canyon City, then this is it. I don’t get that feeling in Brooklyn, but boy, down there the streets are quite narrow and the buildings go up so high that if you wanted to take a photo of them you’d have to plaster 2 or 3 together.</description>

      <description>Today we took the Staten Island Ferry from the southern tip of Manhattan to the north-most point on Staten Island (and back, of course). For a long time the ferry cost only 25 cents for a return trip, then it went up to 50 cents in 1990.</description>

The cards arrived in the mail yesterday, so we are now officially Permanent Residents of the United States of America.</description>

      <description>This week has been a bit trying as Marica has been quite unwell. Monday and Tuesday she had a high fever and was listless and irritable. The listlessness and irritability has continued all week and on Thursday she broke out with a rash which we initially thought was a very bad case of chickenpox.</description>

      <description>This post is about the cool new things our kids can do. :-)
Marica has learned to recognise the numbers 1-6 and is quickly learning 7-10 as well. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that we let her push the buttons in the elevator.</description>

      <description>Ben and I have had lots of chuckles over some product labelling here in the U.S. lately. The term “all natural” seems to be plastered on everything. With such a label, you would assume “healthy”, but is anything edible not natural (in the sense that it has been derived from nature?</description>

      <description>Why is New York City called The Big Apple?
It’s actually one of those old terms that has a sketchy history. Wikipedia tells me it was first used as a term for New York in 1921 by John J Fitz Gerald in a horce-racing context.</description>

      <description>It’s amazing what you notice about a place you’ve lived in for ages when you’re planning a trip overseas. For one thing, Christchurch has a lot of center-city apartments — never noticed ‘em before, but now they’re everywhere.</description>
