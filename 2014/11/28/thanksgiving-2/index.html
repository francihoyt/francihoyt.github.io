<p>Here in the States, people celebrated Thanksgiving yesterday. We’re actually celebrating it today, so that it could work out for Jeremy and Lillian to be here with us.</p>
<p>So, for that reason, and because there’s cooking to be done, I’ll keep this short and leave you with the lyrics of a hymn whose tune I dislike, but that has powerful words. Today, as we sit around our feast table laden with glorious food, we will count our blessings, name them, and give thanks for what God has done.</p>
<p><strong>Count Your Blessings</strong></p>
<p>When upon life’s billows you are tempest-tossed,<br>
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,<br>
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,<br>
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>
<p>Refrain:</p>
<p>Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br>
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!<br>
Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br>
Count your many blessings, see what God hath done.</p>
<p>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?<br>
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?<br>
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,<br>
And you will keep singing as the days go by.</p>
<p>When you look at others with their lands and gold,<br>
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;<br>
Count your many blessings—wealth can never buy<br>
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.</p>
<p>So, amid the conflict whether great or small,<br>
Do not be discouraged, God is over all;<br>
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,<br>
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.</p>
