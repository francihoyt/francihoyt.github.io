<p>The other night we had our temporary landlord over for dinner and as well as having a lovely time, we also found out a bit about some of the art around here. The big painting in the dining room is a replica of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_(painting)">The Storm</a></em> by Pierre Auguste Cot.</p>

<p>We should go check it out at the Met sometime!</p>
<p>Another very interesting thing we found out was that a painting by Edward Hopper that depicts this house sold at Christie’s last year for $36 million ($40.5 million with fees!). It’s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Wind_Over_Weehawken">East Wind Over Weehawken</a> and was painted during the Depression.</p>

<p>Here is what it looks like these days:</p>

<p>Why did they flatten out the houses (from painting to photo) or have those houses been completely rebuilt?</p>

<p>So the painting is of the house you’re staying in?<br>
Speaking of the Met, we are reading a book which has the Met as the main setting … I’ve been meaning to tell you about it, for Marica’s education ;-), but was waiting to pass judgment on the book till we’ve read it all …<br>
But we’re enjoying it so far. It’s called “From the mixed-up files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler” by E L Konigsburg.</p>

<p>Yes, the house on the corner (in front on both painting and photo) is the one we’re staying in — for another week.</p>
