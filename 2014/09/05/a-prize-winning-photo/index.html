<p>With such a sensationalist title, you’d think this is something really special, right? Well, not quite! TripAdvisor (where Ben works) had this internal competition over the summer where you could send in a photo with a TripAdvisor fridge magnet on your vehicle, and every week they picked a winner.</p>
<p>One night, we organised a date night and went and took some photos.  After that we had a fantastic Mexican dinner and got to witness a spectacular lightning storm from our cozy seats inside the restaurant.</p>
<p>Here is our prize-winning entry. Ta-daaa!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2014/09/dsc_0823-large.jpg"><img src="/images/2014/09/dsc_0823-large.jpg" alt="DSC_0823 (Large)" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, you’re probably wondering what we won. No, not a holiday… I wish! A big bag full of useful (and less useful) goodies with TripAdvisor emblazoned on them all. :-)</p>

<p>Aw…they should have given you a trip or something toward a trip.  Nice that you won with such a creative entry, though.</p>

<p>Maybe one with Ben ON the vehicle would have won you the trip.</p>

<p>Or maybe with Ben AND Franci on the vehicle - their usual method of transport in NYC, of course.</p>

<p>Those unicycle photos are just good at winning prizes for the photographers, aren’t they?!</p>

<p>Yes, unicycles win prizes - like one of Ben and Franci’s wedding photos. Interesting, though, that even that one didn’t include Franci on the unicycle.</p>
