<p>When Marica was 4, I got a fancy new camera as <a href="/2011/06/27/glimpses-into-the-last-couple-of-weeks/">a very generous gift</a>. Marica then got our old camera, which was a little point and shoot that was on its way out but still in good condition. Unfortunately it got dropped a few times too many and gave up the ghost. Ever since then, Marica has been hoping and saving for a camera. But you know, you have to do a lot of extra jobs to make money around here, and that’s just not nearly as cool (or profitable!) as having a lemonade stand!</p>

<p>We live on the same block as a big school. Another block away there’s a charter school, and two blocks in the other direction there is a big day care center. (Yes, people think we are crazy when they find out that we homeschool!) Suffice to say, we get a <em>lot</em> of foot traffic  past our house for about half an hour after school gets out.</p>

<p>Marica got pretty excited about the idea of having a lemonade stand, so we said that if she bought the lemons and cups, I’ll help her with it. Well, the first day we had our stand, the lemonade sold out within 10 minutes! The second time we sold iced tea as well. We made more lemonade which all sold out and most of the iced tea went too. The third time we made lemonade, iced tea <em>and</em> we sold chocolate chip cookies! With those 3 stands she made about $70! Seeing that we told her we’d for pay half of the camera she and Ben picked out after researching online which went for $110, she had more than enough! The camera has now been ordered, and its arrival will be cause for great rejoicing. :-)</p>

<p>Way to go, Marica! Looking forward to seeing her perspective from behind the lens.</p>

<p>Good thing you are in Jersey now, or De Blasio might shut you down for lack of a permit</p>

<p>That’s great Marica. Keep the business going! Who knows, you might decide you like being a CEO better than a photographer.</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Grandpa</p>

<p>Wow, Marica, you want to come down and help me set up a lemonade stand?  Not that I have the stellar neighborhood for such an enterprise that you have.  I, too, will look forward to seeing the fruit of your hard work and your purchase!</p>

<p>Marica, I was just about to say that you are a woman after your Grandpa’s heart, and the fact that he entered a comment already just proves my point. He always had ideas for his children to take up innovative roadside businesses, and now his granddaughter has done it!<br>

<p>When I think about the population base per square kilometer, I think you are in a prime spot for a lemonade stand, Marica!  Or any other kind of stand either for that matter.  Great work (Franci too!)</p>
