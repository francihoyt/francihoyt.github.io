<p>Your blog is wonderful! My daughter, Shannon is on her way home from babysitting for you right now. I can’t wait to hear all about it.</p>
<p>I am fairly internet illiterate, but would like to post a comment now and then. I will figure how how to do this.  See ya this Lord’s day. It is great to have you worship and fellowship with us at Merf.</p>
<p>btw-sorry, we looked at the bike again for your daughter and I think it will be too big. Would you like to use our van for an Ikea run in two weeks?  I might be able to go with you too.</p>

<p>Thanks, Julie — I’ve replied via email. Shannon was great with Marica (and Esther) last night, so thanks for the loan of her skills for the evening. :-)</p>
