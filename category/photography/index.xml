      <description>I love the way leaf-less trees look so stark in black and white.
These photos were taken in Prospect Park, Brooklyn a couple of years back.
And this one in Lancaster County.
March was heralded in by a snowstorm, and it looked like this in front of our house just a couple of weeks ago:</description>

      <description>Last week we had another bit of snow. (That was the snow before today’s snow, and Sunday’s snow, and then the two snows before that.) It seems every time Boston gets a foot or more of snow, we get about 2 or 3 inches.</description>

      <description>With such a sensationalist title, you’d think this is something really special, right? Well, not quite! TripAdvisor (where Ben works) had this internal competition over the summer where you could send in a photo with a TripAdvisor fridge magnet on your vehicle, and every week they picked a winner.</description>

      <description>I was washing berries for dessert the other night and just had to stop and marvel that God didn’t just make food useful, He also made it beautiful.
And they tasted delicious!</description>

      <description>The next stop couldn’t have been more different from Las Vegas. Tranquil, rural, isolated, pretty much nobody around, right in nature, and no electricity! We stayed the night in a little cabin/tent outside a small town called Lone Pine, between the Death Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</description>

      <description>When we were visiting the Boonzaaijers’ in Colorado Springs, I decided to get up early one morning to go and take some photos of the Garden of the Gods. I had heard that it was particularly beautiful at sunrise, so I got up at 5am and headed on down there, just as the sky was changing colour.</description>

      <description>So, getting around to posting these last roadtrip posts have crawled to a terribly slow pace, but I’m determined to finish them up. When I get to that point, I’ll evaluate whether or not I keep AliensInTheApple going, or change its name, or just say “So long, and thanks for all the fish.</description>

      <description>I saw this beam at the farm we stayed at when we took Lizel to Lancaster County, and really liked the way the wood grain showed up on it.</description>

      <description>I think the Pennsylvanian countryside is just so beautiful. It seems very peaceful to me, perhaps because I’m usually on holiday when I’m there.
When we took Lizel there when she visited, Marica stayed with dear friends who took her to a ballet concert, so Esther got to be the only child for a weekend.</description>

      <description>I visited Margaret and her family on a drizzly Sunday afternoon in January, and just had to take a photo of this plant in her garden. The water droplets seemed to just stick to it in such a pretty way!</description>

      <description>I’ve got so many photos I’d like to share from my time in New Zealand, but time is eluding me. The photos in the post today were taken in Christchurch, in the new Cashel Mall where they have a mall made out of shipping containers that have been refurbished, and looks way better than it sounds.</description>

      <description>Today is the last day of the black and white series. Thanks for bearing with me. I hope you’re not all now sick and tired of black and white photographs — I love them!
Today’s photos are from when Ben and Marica attended the Nutcracker ballet, December 2011.</description>

He lives in the Eshelmans’ neighbors’ yard who had the lovely little thing refurbished all nice and new, parked it beside the house and haven’t touched it for about 15 years.</description>

      <description>I don’t really care for modern art much, so I’ve never felt a deep desire to go look at what’s inside the Guggenheim museum (I can get my fill at the Met by glimpsing at the modern art section when I walk past there to get to the European sculptures).</description>

      <description>“Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me?” Ps 43:5
That’s what this sculpture by Aristide Maillol brought to mind when I saw it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The artist did an amazing job — it was as if everything about her just felt so sad.</description>

      <description>When I was driving through Philly with Margaret, I was just happily snapping pictures of stuff out of the car while we were driving. I happened to take this picture of a city centre sculpture and when I went through the photos afterwards I saw how perfectly (total fluke) the moon was aligned with this thing.</description>

      <description>Now that you all know that Lillian and Jeremy are engaged, we can all happily say “Hooray!”. Lillian was here for a very short visit (just under 2 weeks) and flew into JFK, so we got the privilege of hosting the two of them for a few nights before they went off to Philadelphia to go get engaged.</description>

      <description>And also pretty fun.
Perhaps “photo shoot” is too formal a title for what we did with Jeremy and Lillian, but I still tried to get a heap of photos while at the same time trying to keep an eye on two speedy escape artists.</description>

      <description>As I said earlier, my previous post kept freezing up because I had too many photos in there, so I instead made the first post the colour post and this one the black&amp;amp;white post. I personally often prefer black and white, so this was fun for me.</description>

      <description>But that makes it sound like it’s a bad thing when it is indeed a very happy thing — the last of 8 children getting married. Yes, that’s right, Ben’s little sister, Lillian, is engaged to be married to a certain Mr Jeremy Fisher, uh, I mean Mr Jeremy L Eshelman!</description>

      <description>I like how the composition of this photo turned out: pretty clover in focus and a couple in the background. Some of the clover leaves look like love hearts… It’s kind of sweet. :-)</description>

      <title>Another beautiful zinnia</title>

      <description>It boggles my mind that God would put such intricate beauty into a simple flower… layer upon layer, curly baby petals… in a pot I too often forget to water.
But then again, it really shouldn’t surprise me.</description>

      <description>Saw this old building on our way to Jeremy’s place in Philadelphia, and couldn’t help noticing the irony.</description>

      <description>Trust is knowing that we are small and God is big and that He will not let us go.</description>

      <description>The outside of our house at the back is painted in a vivid blue. I’ve planted some zinnias in pots, and the colour contrast is great. I had some fun taking photos of a couple of flowers the other day.</description>
