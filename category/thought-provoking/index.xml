      <description>As the cruel parents we are, tonight we decided to make Marica grate – again:
Sorry, couldn’t resist.
But after I thought of the pun, I think there’s a serious point here, along the lines of that P.</description>

      <description>The year starts off differently here in the northern hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere. In some ways it doesn’t really feel like a new year — school and work just keeps going after a short break for Christmas; whereas in NZ just about nothing happens the first few weeks of January because 90% of the country is off somewhere on holiday.</description>

      <description>To you, commuter on the 6.15am bus
who study on spinning wheels for an hour before a long day of work:
Well done, good and faithful servant.
To you, mother of small children
who have wiped more noses and bottoms and floors than you could count:</description>

      <description>Introduction This is a written version of a pre-Christmas talk I gave at work recently, about the intersection between Christianity and hacker culture. There’s also a video available here — the sound quality’s not brilliant, but feel free to watch it there!</description>

      <description>I wasn’t, but Chuck Geschke was.
Let me back up a bit: for Christmas, Franci gave me a true geek book called Masterminds of Programming, which I reviewed in detail here. One of the interviews was with the creators of PostScript, a computer language used to control printers.</description>

      <description>New York…
Your name invoked images, awe, presumptions
of ghetto, gangster, glamour, glitz.
Yet many will be surprised to know
I found in you much goodness and grace
just as ingrained
as the grit and grime.</description>

      <description>For your interest, here’s a list of some of the books we’ve read in the last year or so, with a tiny summary of each. Most of them are really good. I’ve put B after the author’s name if only I’ve read it, F if just Franci’s read it, or BF if we’ve both read it.</description>

      <title>The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</title>
      <link>https://aliensintheapple.com/2011/12/23/the-autobiography-of-benjamin-franklin/</link>

      <description>Some time ago Franci picked up a little, falling-apart paperback version of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. As well as having a pretty respectable first name, Franklin was a fascinating character in many respects. Was he a printer, a writer, a politician, or an inventor?</description>

      <description>What a great gift to have a whole feast day dedicated to giving thanks! I’m relishing the opportunity to celebrate Thanksgiving while we’re here in the States. It might even be a tradition we take home to New Zealand with us!</description>

      <title>Is Christianity sexist?</title>
      <link>https://aliensintheapple.com/2011/11/19/is-christianity-sexist/</link>

      <guid>https://aliensintheapple.com/2011/11/19/is-christianity-sexist/</guid>
      <description>Perhaps the most-prayed Christian prayer is the Lord’s Prayer: “Our Father who art in heaven…” But why Father and not person or parent? Is Christianity sexist?
Our home church denomination recently held a national Synod meeting, and one of the things they discussed was the updated 2011 translation of the NIV Bible.</description>

      <description>I don’t usually share particularly personal experiences here on the blog, but this is a bit of an exception as I thought some of you might find it strangely encouraging too.
In the last few weeks, I have had a profound sense of the weight and enormity of my sin and selfishness.</description>
