      <description>I love the way leaf-less trees look so stark in black and white.

      <description>Today is the last day of the black and white series. Thanks for bearing with me. I hope you’re not all now sick and tired of black and white photographs — I love them!
Today’s photos are from when Ben and Marica attended the Nutcracker ballet, December 2011.</description>

      <description>A statue of The Signer in Philadelphia.
This photo is significant, because today a man from Philadelphia is signing a very special contract with a very special lady in Christchurch. Yes, today Jeremy and Lillian are getting married!</description>

      <description>To start off the black and white series while I’m away, I thought I’d introduce you to Planter. He lives in the Eshelmans’ neighbors’ yard who had the lovely little thing refurbished all nice and new, parked it beside the house and haven’t touched it for about 15 years.</description>
