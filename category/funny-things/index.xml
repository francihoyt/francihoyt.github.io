      <description>As the cruel parents we are, tonight we decided to make Marica grate – again:
Sorry, couldn’t resist.
But after I thought of the pun, I think there’s a serious point here, along the lines of that P.</description>

      <description>I’ve been searching for a preschool for Laurelin for a couple of mornings a week. I think it’ll be good for her, and it will help the two older girls and me get a bit more done in school.</description>

      <description>A few years back, on a whim, I decided to start a fun tradition for April Fool’s Day dinner: dessert for dinner (and no need to have dinner for dessert!). Turns out the kids think this is great, but the adults give a little groan at the thought.</description>

      <description>At lunch the other day, Laurelin was playing peek-a-boo with her bib, which was hilariously cute, because she’d stare out the neck hole at us thinking she was invisible!</description>

      <description>If your daughter asks you for French toast, then you’ll be tempted to just say ‘no’. It’s a weekday, after all. But then you’ll remember that you want to be more of a ‘yes’ parent than a ‘no’ parent.</description>

      <description>My computer desk is just next to the couch, and one day while I was doing things on the computer and the girls were watching a show, I looked over and just had to quickly snap a picture of the girls enjoying it!</description>

      <description>I was folding washing this morning listening to Marica and Esther talk, and just had to share this funny:
E: “Mawica, dose are nithe octoputheth.”
M: “They aren’t octopuses, they’re decorations!
E: “Dey look like octoputheth…”</description>

      <description>This post is specially for grandparents, aunties and other such doting people who would be interested in these videos of our little Lorax.
Marica loves to play rough and tumble with Laurelin, but she’s very careful not to be too rough.</description>

      <description>Reaga is a mix between reading and yoga. Marica has invented it without even knowing!
The other day I was sitting at the computer doing stuff when I saw something out of the corner of my eye that didn’t look quite right.</description>

      <description>The other day I found this:
It just tickled my funny bone that Esther would dress Woody in a dress! Despite the brave face he’s putting on, he’s secretly mortified.</description>

      <description>The other day Ben and I were walking along when we spotted a car that had been very tightly parked in.
The back:
The front:
Lo and behold, imagine our disbelief and glee when we see the person whose car it is come along and get in the car and proceed to get out of the spot!</description>

      <description>Since the last time I posted, we’ve moved into our temporary apartment for the month of March, settled into a daily routine with homeschooling in the mornings, and all of us have gotten sick. New climate, new bugs — it was to be expected!</description>

      <description>Last night I was sitting down and my mind thought up a riddle all by itself. It’s useful like that. See if you can figure it out:

      <description>Esther walked past my study this morning and said, “Dad, I see you in your office, but there’s nothing inside your pants!” Almost certainly thinking of this Dr Seuss book, here’s what she had seen:</description>

      <description>The next stop couldn’t have been more different from Las Vegas. Tranquil, rural, isolated, pretty much nobody around, right in nature, and no electricity! We stayed the night in a little cabin/tent outside a small town called Lone Pine, between the Death Valley and the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</description>

      <description>We were having a picnic in Prospect Park when Lizel was here and there was this man doing his stretches against a tree.
We joked with the kids that the man was trying to push over the tree, and do they want to go and help him?</description>

      <description>Some of you might remember Jeremy and Lillian’s bizarre cake eating rituals at their wedding ceremony in New Zealand. Well, it would seem the strangeness just keeps on going.
Just look at the mess they made of my beautiful lemon cake.</description>

      <description>In Central Park there is this cool playground that has a herd of hippos made out of fibre glass (?? I guess). The kids always think it’s fun to pretend to ride the hippos.
So do some of the adults.</description>

      <description>The other day we received an incredible free magazine: NEWLIFE EXPO — America’s Largest Mind, Body, Spirit Expo. Its highly intelligent content, its carefully-placed typos, and its cohesive aesthetic have provided Franci and me with more belly laughs than any comedy magazine ever could.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday afternoon and evening, a few of Jeremy’s Philadelphia friends organized a bachelor party for him. They captured him, got in a little bit of trouble with the Philly police, and drove him blind-folded all the way to New York, where I joined them for dinner.</description>

      <description>Every time I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art I see something I haven’t seen before, and I certainly go back to old favourites. Recently I took some photos with a hairy theme. Some of them are so ridiculous, you’d have to be an old stodge not to even get a slight smile at the lips.</description>

Perhaps “photo shoot” is too formal a title for what we did with Jeremy and Lillian, but I still tried to get a heap of photos while at the same time trying to keep an eye on two speedy escape artists.</description>

      <description>GENEVA TRIBUNE, August 1517.
New things are afoot in the world of Scripture freedom. Two days ago a hacker, who goes under the pseudonym Mart1n Luth3r, released a set of 95 bullet points outlining how to hack iChurch’s core systems.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday I (Ben) turned 30, and an otherwise ordinary workday was turned into Something Special by my lovely wife. She’d been being secretive about something for a few weeks, so I guessed something was going to happen, but I had no idea what.</description>

      <description>When we were visiting Jeremy in Philly, I made some grilled mushrooms on the barbecue with fresh parmesan, salt, pepper, butter and fresh mozzarella cheese, garnished with a fresh basil leaf. Are your mouths watering yet?</description>

      <description>A couple of weekends ago, we visited our good friend, Jeremy, in Philadelphia.
What a blast — we did some sight-seeing, but also my favourite pastime: having good discussions over good food.
There was of course also an appropriate amount of teasing which Jeremy thrived upon.</description>

      <description>Esther’s fine motor skills are very well developed, at least when it comes to opening things. Somehow she managed to open the coffee packet the other day and spill grounds all over the floor. But then you see that expression and how can’t you laugh?</description>

      <description>Marica said I looked beautiful after she was finished making me beautiful. Ben came home and called me hideous. I’ll let you decide for yourself!
It was cold and rainy a fair bit back in March, so one day when Marica asked if she could make me pretty, I consented.</description>

      <description>When I went to The Cloisters with Hannah and Eva, there were a few sculptures/carvings that I took pictures of purely to post on here with funny comments, because they sure made us crack up. My apologies go to the artists who did not create their masterpieces for us to laugh at, and to those of you who find Roman Catholic artefacts more meaningful than un-cultured moi.</description>
