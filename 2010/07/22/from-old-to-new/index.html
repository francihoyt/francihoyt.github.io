<p>Last week I had fun being a bit creative using stuff that was left here from the previous tenant and sprucing them up a bit. The whole Reduce, Recycle and Reuse slogan comes to mind, but also making things pretty for cheap really appeals to me. So let me show you what I did.</p>
<p>There were 4 wall squares just outside the back door. They were peeling and not quite my thing, so I gave them a scrub:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03989.jpg"><img title="on the wall" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03989.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>and then proceeded to spray paint them a beige sort of colour.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03994.jpg"><img title="beige" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03994.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Then Marica and I had some great fun splattering blue…</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03996.jpg"><img title="blue splatters" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03996.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>then yellow…</p>
<p><img title="Yellow" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03997.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>and then pink paint on them.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03999.jpg"><img title="Splatter!" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03999.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>Who’s this pretty girl painting with me?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc04001.jpg"><img title="Cute painter 1" src="/images/2010/07/dsc04001.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><a href="/images/2010/07/dsc03997.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The end result is much chirpier in my opinion, and I had fun doing something creative with Marica! (Note that nowhere have I called this <em>art.</em>)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc04002.jpg"><img title="End result" src="/images/2010/07/dsc04002.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Total cost: $13</p>
<p>Now let me show you the stools that were out in the back yard. Our place here is a bit short on things to sit on, so I wanted to make these useable without getting splinters in your behind whenever you sat on them. There also happened to be far too much shower curtain in our bathroom…</p>
<p>This is what I started with:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03992.jpg"><img title="The culprits" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03992.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Then I scrubbed the metal legs and spray painted them beige (same colour as the wall squares). I don’t think I took a photo of this step. The next day I went on the hottest walk in the universe with the kids to the nearest fabric store to buy some foam, which I cut up into the appropriate size when I got home. The shower curtains (one plain and one patterned) got chopped as well.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc03993.jpg"><img title="Foam and Friends" src="/images/2010/07/dsc03993.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I asked the guy at the hardware store if I could rent his staple gun ($5 for a couple of hours is way better than buying it for $20 if I’m never going to use it again) and proceeded to assemble the ingredients with a bit of help from Ben (you sometimes needed an extra hand with pulling the plastic tight <em>and </em> using the staple gun!).</p>
<p>Ta-daa!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/07/dsc04041.jpg"><img title="The End" src="/images/2010/07/dsc04041.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Total cost: $15</p>
<p>The satisfaction of turning something ugly into something chirpy and useful: priceless.

<p>You should be on the next commercial for MasterCard or whatever it is.  You sure had a cute (and surprisingly paint free) helper, Franci!</p>

<p>The difference is that Franci doesn’t get delusions of grandeur and try to sell her/Marica’s artwork for millions of dollars. :-)</p>

<p>Oh dear! Did you make sure it’s ok to cut up the shower curtains?! VERY well done, Franci. It’s inspiring :-)</p>

<p>Very classy. I have vague recollections of being younger and creative like that. Well…the younger part, anyway.</p>

<p>Beautifully done, Franci.  Did someone say GenYers were not frugally creative?!  The colours were great.  So glad you’ve caught up with Melissa and Nathan.</p>
