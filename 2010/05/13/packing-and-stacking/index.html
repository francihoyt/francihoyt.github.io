<p style="text-align:left;">When Ben came home 2 weeks ago and told me that we were leaving for NYC in 4 1/2 weeks instead of the original 12 weeks, I went into a mini panic, so to speak. We made a list of all the things he needed to do and what I needed to do. His list was quite long and included things like “cancel utilities”. My list was quite short - it said “pack”.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have to pack up all our belongings to go into storage for 2 years, except for the things that we can fit into our suitcases, which even though we have 8 pieces of luggage, isn’t very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So we’ve seen a lot of this kind of thing recently:</p>
<a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03386.jpg"><img title="Boxes" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03386.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Even Marica has been quite useful (sort of):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03411.jpg"><img title="Marica with bubble wrap" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03411.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>She’s been really good at keeping herself entertained too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03414.jpg"><img title="Marica's handiwork" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And while there is certain satisfaction in seeing good progress in packing, it seems that there is something inherently wrong and desolate about an empty bookcase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03415.jpg"><img title="Empty bookcases" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03415.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It reminds me of when my parents moved to New Zealand from Namibia and were selling truckloads of stuff and a guy came to my parents and asked if he could buy their bookcases “with the books”. It was intended to go into his office (I think he was a local pastor) and he didn’t care what the books were, he just knew that lots of books on the bookshelf makes you look intelligent and important. :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m really looking forward to buying books in the States - it’s so much cheaper there. And then we might have to expand our bookcase collection from 4 to 5!</p>

<p>Enjoy the packing… Not much fun, but very memorable!<br>
Maybe we could catch up some time. Lord Willing we are heading off to NJ in a couple of weeks. Aparently we’re not going to be too far away from NY. It would be nice to catch up with you guys again.</p>

<p>Hardly seems fair to say that your list consists of pack.  Doesn’t do it justice at all.  Don’t forget you also have on your list clean, (yet another term that hardly does what is required justice).  Have fun and all the best.</p>

<p>Ha! I admit to arranging the bookself to seem the most well rounded and intelligent. One thing you’ll love here in Brooklyn is you’ll find great books free out on people’s stoops! It feels like half of our apartment is furnished with free stuff found on stoops.</p>
