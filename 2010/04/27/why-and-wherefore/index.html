<p>Several people have asked us why we’re heading away, so here’s a brief run-down. We’ve been thinking about a U.S. holiday for a few years now, but then we thought it might make more sense to save up for a U.S. holiday in the U.S.</p>
<p>I (Ben) am a U.S. citizen, so it’s fairly straightforward for me to work over here. But the first step was me finding work. It turns out that <a href="http://www.oyster.com/">Oyster Hotel Reviews</a> saw <a href="http://benhoyt.com/cv">my CV online</a> shortly after I put it up early this year. Coincidence? Methinks not.</p>
<p>We weren’t looking in New York City by any means, but that’s where Oyster’s based. And Oyster wasn’t necessarily looking for programmers from New Zealand. So we both thought we’d give it a try, and I went over there to work for them for three weeks in March. That went really well, and they somehow convinced us that the Big Apple wasn’t half bad. :-)</p>
<p>The next step was Franci and the kids applying for visas. It turns out that because we were planning to stay two years, and because I’m a citizen, “they” didn’t trust us not to stay, and that would have made Franci and the kids overstayers. Kinda weird logic. So we had to apply for immigration visas — quite a drama, reams of paperwork, and no small cost. But now we’re all in!</p>
<p>So there we are: trying to finish up and pack up here, and flying to NYC in about four weeks. Oyster’s offices are in Manhattan (NY city centre), but it’s likely we’ll live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. It looks like we’ll be in a temporary, furnished apartment for the first month, and we’ll look for a longer-term rental after that. We’ll post photos when we can!</p>
