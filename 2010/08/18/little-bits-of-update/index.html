<p>I’m slowly settling into the groove of life here in NYC again and today we ventured out to the Prospect Park Zoo. I’m sure you with dial-up will be delighted to know that I forgot my camera at home. :-) For those of you familiar with Willowbank in Christchurch — the Prospect Park Zoo was very similar. So, great for little kids, probably not that great for older kids. I bought us a year pass that gives us entry to the NY Aquarium, Bronx Zoo, Prospect Park Zoo (in Brooklyn), Central Park Zoo, and Queens Zoo. I’m thinking we’ll get our money’s worth! We can take an adult along for free, so if anyone’s keen…</p>
<p>In other breaking news — Esther is now the proud owner of not one, not two, but THREE teeth! She cut her top 2 two days in a row at the Hoyt reunion, and yesterday her first front bottom tooth. Suffice to say that she doesn’t like teething. And neither do the rest of us. :-)</p>
<p>Our house is slowly turning into a home. I’m having quite a fun time acquiring pretty things for cheap or free, but I’ll tell you more about that later. We hope to make another trip to IKEA this weekend to get a few more pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>And to finish random bits of (useless?) info, here’s something to put a confused smile on your face. And no, I don’t get it either.

<p>Jerky is a snack food that is comprised of strips of beef that have been dried and become hardened. The fact that this is a West Indian restaurant helps explain the name because they like this in the islands of the West Indies. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Go Esther.  Sounds like she is teething in the same style as Eva.  Saw the photos of the reunion and wondered if she was teething as she seemed a little out of sorts in some photos and that doesn’t seem like the happy sweet Esther we know.  Miss you all.  Miriam and family.</p>
