<p>I’ve you’re an avid follower of our blog, you will have noticed that our posts have been rather sparse the last 2 and a half weeks. We’ve had a great time away traipsing over the country visiting family. First we spent a week in the Rocky Mountains at the Tschetter (Ben’s mum’s side of the family) reunion. Ben then flew home and I tagged along with his parents to go to the Hoyt reunion in Tyler, Texas.</p>
<p>What an amazing time meeting so many members of Ben’s extended family on both sides, taking in some spectacular scenery and doing some cool hikes in the Rocky Mountains, eating far too much good food, playing all sorts of games (dominoes, Settlers of Catan, charades, freeze to name but a few) and experiencing some of the vastness of the United States with driving two 11-hour days first between Allenspark, CO and Smolan, KS, and then from Smolan and Tyler, TX.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll just give me a few days to get my head back into New York gear and to being back to all my usual responsibilities, I’ll find some time (I think there’s some hiding in a closet here somewhere) to do a couple of photo posts to share.</p>
