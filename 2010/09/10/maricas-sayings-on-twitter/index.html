<p>So here’s Marica’s Twitter page, which we sometimes remember to add her sayings to:</p>

<p>Thanks, Marcelle. Yeah, some of them are pretty funny. Usually when Marica says something weird and wonderful, Franci and I will just look at each other and grin a this-needs-to-go-on-Twitter kind of grin.</p>

<p>Can you just see Bev, Hendrik and I (Elrike) bending over the laptop reading those lines from Marica and cracking up with pretty much every one of them! As usual, one could almost laugh just as much at Hendrik laughing as one laughs at the quotes. We might steal that idea for when Erika starts talking, if that’s ok. Mrs Voges explained some of them to us last night at church. However, she never got to explain the ‘smoking with Ouma’-one. Hmm…</p>

<p>Heh, we can almost hear Hendrik laughing! Sure, we hereby place the idea in the public domain. :-) I’m sure you’ll let us know when she starts talking.</p>

<p>I’m enjoying picturing Bevan, Elrike, and Hendrik laughing at the tweets (or just joining whatever’s making Hendrik and Carline laugh); I’ve had fun introducing people to Mr. Bean’s beekeeper interview, which always brings them to mind.  Guess that’s my favorite laughing with the Bakker’s episode.  :)  And, yes, the tweets are great.  It’s a perfect way to let us share in Marica’s thoughts and humor…but please translate the Afrikaans EVERY time!</p>

<p>Wow, if Marica can already distinguish between “lay down” and “lie down” at three…just think of all the grammar mistakes she’ll notice by the time she’s a big girl!</p>
