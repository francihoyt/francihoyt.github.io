<p>Last night we had some company (a work colleague of Ben’s) and I made a new recipe. I have a very bad habit of trying new recipes when we have people over, but this time it was definitely a winner! It’s called <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Aussie-Chicken/Detail.aspx">Aussie Chicken</a> and it is a delicious combo of chicken, bacon, mushrooms, cheese and honey mustard sauce. You really can’t lose! Serve with rice and salad to cause some serious happiness.</p>
<p>They brought some cupcakes for dessert (cupcakes are really big here in NYC) and Marica enjoyed the icing.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2010/09/dsc04476.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/09/dsc04485.jpg"><img title="Yum!" src="/images/2010/09/dsc04485.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a><a href="/images/2010/09/dsc045291.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Other exciting news is that we’re having some more guests. Ten of them, to be exact! The van Wichens (Ben’s oldest sister and her family) are staying with us on Thursday and Friday night and on Friday we’re packing in as much of New York City as is possible with 10 children in tow. It’s going to be interesting here with them camping in the backyard and in various spots throughout the apartment on the floor and totally worth it — can’t wait!</p>
<p>Oh, and I can’t resist adding in this photo of Esther, The Bath Lover, having pulled herself up and standing looking at the bath filling up!</p>

<p>And one last one to make you smile: Tandem Airplane Rides with Pappa!</p>

<p>Tandem airplane rides, what an idea!  Wow, didn’t know the van Wichens were staying *with* you.  Our house and yard should seem large after NYC.  :)</p>

<p>So cute.  Definitely think Esther looks more like your side of the family Franci.  Sorry haven’t emailed you back yet.  Much love, Miriam and family</p>
