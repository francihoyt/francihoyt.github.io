<p><a href="/images/2010/10/dsc04815.jpg"></a>Stepping into Little Italy is like being overseas for a little while. The streets (Mulberry Street in particular) is decorated in Italian colours — red, green and white.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc04776.jpg"><img title="Mulberry Street" src="/images/2010/10/dsc04776.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The place is littered with restaurants, and pizza shops and places selling “Italian Specialties” like meats, breads and desserts.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc04777.jpg"><img title="Italian Specialties" src="/images/2010/10/dsc04777.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>

<p>Of course you cannot have Italian and not have fashion. I couldn’t resist photographing this little number. I wonder what kind of occasion would warrant wearing something like this?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc04779.jpg"><img title="Italian Fashion" src="/images/2010/10/dsc04779.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>We had lunch at one of the restaurants, sort of by accident. They have Real Italians standing outside the restaurant selling it to you and trying to convince you to come in. And anyone who’s ever had anything to do with Italians know that they’re a hard bunch to say no to!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc04810.jpg"><img title="More restaurants" src="/images/2010/10/dsc04810.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The place gave us complimentary delicious bread and dip and we ordered pizza. We made the mistake of ordering coffee (we thought the Italians knew how to do this properly) but it tasted horrible. So, in our experience, eat the food in Little Italy, leave the coffee.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc04792.jpg"><img title="Free bread and dip" src="/images/2010/10/dsc04792.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>We asked some random person on the street to take a family shot of us. It’s always a bit hit-and-miss with asking people to take your photo, and in this case it was a bit miss. Esther almost didn’t make it into the photo!</p>

<p>at least its in focus. if it was us asking, we’d have a nice clear shot of the guy shoveling food in his face to the right and we’d be all blurry. almost every photo other’s have taken for us is like that.</p>
