<p>This past week seems to have been shorter than the others. Strange how that happens sometimes. Maybe it was because I didn’t have to cook very often! The flu was still having a field day, uh, week at our house and even Ben stayed home for 2 days from work. I didn’t make all the things that I planned for because the pizza was enough for 2 nights and we got a dinner invite for Saturday night, <em>and</em> we got Chinese on Friday night. Three nights not having to cook, wow! And it would seem as if I won’t have to cook too much next week either because I have a bunch of meals in the freezer that I’ve made extra and froze over the last month.</p>
<p>So, here’s what I bought:</p>
<p>fresh fruit &amp; veggies — $10.84<br>
gallon of milk — $3.39<br>
curry powder — $0.99<br>
salami — $3.99</p>
<p>Total: $19.21</p>
<p>So far this month I’ve spent a total of $89.50, which leaves the generous amount of $10.50 for the next week! Haha, I guess I’ll go over, but let’s see with how little, eh?</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re eating for the last week of the challenge:</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Mexican soup and cornmeal muffins</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong></p>
<p>Spaghetti Bolognaise with garlic bread and salad</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday </strong>(we’re having guests)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Beef roast with roast vegetables and salad. Pumpkin cake for dessert.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong></p>
<p>Chicken pasta bake and green salad</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Visiting friends, so I don’t have to cook. Yay!</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong></p>
<p>Ben and I hope to go on a date night. Not sure what we’ll give the kids yet, but maybe nachos.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong></p>
<p>Sandwiches or left-overs for dinner.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that we’d never be eating this amount of meat at $25 a week if I didn’t have stuff in my freezer already! I’ll be glad when this challenge is over. It’s just SO not realistic, but that wasn’t the point, was it? The point was to teach myself that it is possible not to always overspend on my grocery budget, and one that I think I’ve learnt. :-)</p>
