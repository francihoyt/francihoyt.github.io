<p>Ben and I have had lots of chuckles over some product labelling here in the U.S. lately. The term “all natural” seems to be plastered on everything. With such a label, you would assume “healthy”, but is anything edible not natural (in the sense that it has been derived from nature?). Usually these things labelled “all natural” are stuffed full of natural high fructose corn syrup and sugar! But we’re learning to look at the labels.</p>
<p>Ingredients on a sugar packet: “100% natural crystallized cane juice.”</p>
<p>And a quote on a sugar packet: “Sugar is a 100% natural simple carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are an important part of any balanced diet. Sugar contains no fat or cholesterol and has 15 calories per teaspoon.”</p>
<p>Makes you sound like a troll if you don’t want to give your kids heaps of it!</p>

<p>Hmm, sorry Hannah, that’s annoying. Not sure why the first two times didn’t work. I hope not everyone’s had that happen. Anyway, looks like you’re on the list now. :-)</p>
