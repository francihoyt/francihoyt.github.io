<p>We got the tummy bug over the weekend — fun for the whole family! But Franci’s “bug” hung around, and then got more and more painful. Turns out she has acute appendicitis. They’re going to cut her open tonight (might as well not “mince” words) and remove her appendix.</p>
<p>But thank God for high-tech medicine and quick diagnoses! Prayer appreciated.</p>

May the Lord watch over the surgery and grant a quick recovery.  Thanks for letting us know.  I will send out a prayer alert.  Hope the health insurance is comprehensive!<br>
Every blessing in Him,<br>

<p>We’re praying Ben and Franci - that the surgery goes/went well and that you recover quickly.  We’ll also pray that your little ones don’t get too upset or worried about what’s happening to Mum.</p>

<p>By now the deed is probably done.  We are praying for a good recovery and look forward to your next post or email, Benjamin.  With our love, Mum</p>

<p>Dear Marica,</p>
<p>Your Ouma tells me that your Mamma had to go to hospital for an operation.  Please give her a hug from me, and tell her that I am praying for her and you all.  I hope you and your Pappa are feeling MUCH better now.  Hopefully Esther doesn’t get that nasty bug.  You’re probably being a super good girl and helper for your Pappa aye - he’ll be missing your Mamma.  Hug for you and little Esther too.  Love from Marcelle.</p>
