<p>Just letting any readers know that the surgeon was able to remove Franci’s inflamed appendix successfully. Apparently it was pretty close to bursting when they operated. She’s sore and tired, but seems to be recovering well. We’re very thankful (to the Great Physician, especially) that it went smoothly and the doctors were able to act fast. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>We’d still love to be able to go to Philadelphia this weekend, but at this stage it’s still up in the air.</p>
<p>Note that Franci isn’t really blogging from hospital. The blog post “Taking a little break” that appeared this morning is one that Franci scheduled last week to self-publish today. The wonders of modern blogging software … tricking people into thinking you recover super-fast. :-)</p>

<p>Yes, the “wonders” of modern software.  Think of the limitless opportunities for those who want to give wrong impressions, falsify evidence, misconstrue what people wrote.  I could go on, but you’ve no doubt read more such examples than I have.  At least Franci’s “trick” (to use your term) was totally unintended!</p>

<p>Mum, how unlike you, pouring forth your love on technology like that! :-) Actually, Franci uses that “trick” to help her fit blogging into her schedule — she can often have 3 or 4 posts written a week in advance.</p>
