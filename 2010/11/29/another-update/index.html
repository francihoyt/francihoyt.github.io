<p>I’m just now home from a second trip to the hospital and feeling much better than last week! After getting home last week I couldn’t keep food down and felt dizzy all the time. We made a kind of last-minute decision to go to the Braunings after all and spent Friday night with them. Their hospitality was so gracious and they let me lie down and rest most of the time, but I was still not feeling any better or keeping much food down or in, and I also was in more pain, so we came home on Saturday and I went in to the ER again on the doctor’s recommendation, and they kept me in hospital for 2 nights. I’m now virtually pain-free and have kept food down since yesterday, so that’s great.</p>
<p>Blogging might be a bit sporadic as I recover (I usually like to have a week’s worth of posts ready to go a week ahead of time, but now I’ve got nothing!). I’ll tell you a bit more about our visit to the Braunings, and about my hospital adventures later in the week when you can tune in to hear about 3cm nostrils, the Wailing Woman and Miss China.</p>

<p>That sounds like a hard recovery! I’m sorry you were not well enough to enjoy the food at Braunings; on the other hand, I’m sure you are glad you could go, if for no other reason than for the rest of the family. I’ll look forward to the report when you get to it, but take your time and get your rest.</p>
<p>It is good to hear you are doing better now after the extra nights in the hospital.</p>
