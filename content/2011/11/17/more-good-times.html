<p>Our last overnight stop on our roadtrip with my parents was at Mr &amp; Mrs Brauning’s place. Mr Brauning is a pastor who came and filled our pulpit for a few months while our home congregation was vacant and the Braunings are loved by many back home.</p>
<p>I can not believe that I did not even get a photo of their house OR of them together. What was I thinking?! I did get a photo of the flag in front of their house, though!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4173-large.jpg"><img title="US flag" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4173-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Mr Brauning graciously took my parents and me to Philadelphia for a day (while Ben kept the kids home to give them a break from driving for a day!) and showed us around. It was raining, so we did most of our sight-seeing by car, which actually meant we got to see more! On the way to Philadelphia, we stopped in at the chapel where Mr Brauning was the pastor for a good number of years. It was beautiful and rustic, but what was great was that we got treated to a mini organ recital by the resident organist (whom Mr Brauning knew) who was practising for the next service . My mum was in her element!</p>

<p>From there we took a beautiful river drive into Philadelphia where we saw all sorts of interesting sights:</p>
<p>City Hall,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4202-large.jpg"><img title="City Hall" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4202-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The Museum of Art,</p>

<p>the Italian market (hmm, is that what it was called? Anyway, it was an outdoor/indoor market) where I bought some yummy cheese at this great little cheese shop (isn’t that a neat photo?),</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4215-large.jpg"><img title="Cheese shop (I love this pic!)" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4215-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Tenth Presbyterian Church,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4204-large.jpg"><img title="10th pres" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4204-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>the Liberty Bell,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4221-large.jpg"><img title="Liberty" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4221-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4227-large.jpg"><img title="Liberty Bell" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4227-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>At the Liberty Bell there was a donation box full of cash, and I just thought it made a cool photo.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4229-large.jpg"><img title="Dosh. Moolah. Lots of it." src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4229-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>After that we had a lovely lunch out with Mr Brauning at a restaurant that’s on a boat on the Delaware river. He knows the owner/chef and it was a very special privilege to meet him, hear his testimony, and taste his great cooking! It was a really great meal and we felt truly spoilt!</p>

<p>Talking about food — we had some <em>amazing</em> food cooked by Mrs Brauning. She’s a good cook! And I didn’t even take a photo of that wonderful lady. Sorry, Mrs Brauning! I did take some photos last year, so if you need a reminder, <a href="/2010/12/07/a-few-lovely-photos/">here’s one</a>. They haven’t aged a bit since last year.</p>
<p>The next morning Mr Brauning left early to fly out to Mexico, and around mid-morning we headed out too. We stopped at <a href="http://www.terhuneorchards.com/">an apple orchard</a> just outside of Princeton to pick some apples. The kids enjoyed apple picking, the animals, free apples and the apple cider donuts!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4273-large.jpg"><img title="Terhune Orchards" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4273-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4290-large.jpg"><img title="Terhune Orchards Esther feeding a goat. Finally not scared anymore!" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4290-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p>From there we drove through the picturesque university town of Princeton,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4298-large.jpg"><img title="Princeton" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4298-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>through New Jersey, over the Verrazano Bridge into Brooklyn,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4311-large.jpg"><img title="Over the Verrazano Bridge" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4311-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And back into New York.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4315-large.jpg"><img title="Back in NYC" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4315-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="377" /></a></p>
<p>And thus ends my reporting of another road trip. I think the next roadtrip we’ll be taking will be when we leave NYC next year to make our way west, and home.</p>
