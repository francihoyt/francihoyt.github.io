<p>Just a little note: I’m not blogging real-time. I think I might have blogged about something on the same day it happened about twice in the whole time I’ve had this blog. I just don’t have the luxury of lots of time to be able to do that! :-) This road trip happened mid-October, so it shows you just how slow I am! Goodness, we did some cool stuff in the spring that I still want to blog about!</p>
<p>Anyway, after taking the boat trip to see the falls close up, we drove down south to visit our friends, the Tysons. It was a long drive and we were all well and truly sick of sitting in a car by the end of it. Mrs Tyson had a lovely dinner ready for us by the time we got there and their cosy home was a lovely place of rest that evening. After some good conversation and a competitive game of Scrabble, we had an early night to bed!</p>
<p>We enjoyed another tour of the Tysons lovely property and heard about all the major changes that their property has seen the seven years that they have been there — they have done quite a lot of work on it!</p>

<p>Mrs Tyson showing Marica how these things-whose-name-has-now-escaped-me stick to your clothes.</p>

<p>I love how you can see the little hooks in this picture.</p>

<p>Marica of course enjoyed running around on the big lawns and trying to climb trees. I think she likes the <em>idea</em> of tree climbing more than actually doing it, and Ouma had to help!</p>

<p>I love Marica’s face in this one!</p>

<p>This is such a special photo! Cuddles with Mrs Tyson.</p>

<p>And of course we had to have the customary group photos before we left. :-)</p>

<p>I enjoyed taking some more ‘interesting/nature shots’ on the Tysons’ property:</p>

<p>The next day we drove on through Lancaster County to visit our friends, the Braunings (I’ll tell about that visit in another blog post!).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/11/dsc_4146-large.jpg"><img title="no machinery" src="/images/2011/11/dsc_4146-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>We stopped in Intercourse where the men looked after the kids for an hour and a half and mum and I looked through the shops. It was the fastest 1.5 hours in the world! Very enjoyable, though!</p>

<p>We drove past tidy little farms as the sun was setting, and it seemed so… peaceful, somehow. And somehow very American with those barns.</p>
