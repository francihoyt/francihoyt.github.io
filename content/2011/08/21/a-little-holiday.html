<p>Hey everyone, I’m going on a little computer holiday for the next week or so, so you won’t be getting blog posts, and I most likely won’t be replying to emails. If you need to contact me, I’ll probably be keeping skype on so you can contact me that way, or email Ben, or phone me. :-)</p>
<p>I’ll be back in September!</p>
