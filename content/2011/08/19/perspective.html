<p>I like how the composition of this photo turned out: pretty clover in focus and a couple in the background.  Some of the clover leaves look like love hearts… It’s kind of sweet. :-)</p>
<p>It would be even sweeter if the couple were Jeremy and Lillian, but alas, I have not yet had that opportunity. There is a post about those two in the works, but you’ll have to wait until they’ve proof-read it.  Don’t want to get in trouble again. :-)</p>
