<p>It’s quiet because I’m home alone, which is a rare event indeed! Ben took the girls to Prospect Park this morning and I have some time to myself here at home. Guess what I’ve chosen to spend my time doing? Baking! And taking photos of it. And I’m blissfully enjoying myself. :-) I wish I could post some smells on here, but alas, if you want to smell it for yourself, you’ll have to either come over and visit, or <a href="http://www.marthastewart.com/344840/soft-and-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies?czone=food/cookies-cnt/everyday-favorites&amp;backto=true&amp;backtourl=/photogallery/chocolate-chip-cookie-recipes#slide_1">bake some of these</a> yourself. They’re goooood.</p>
<p>I’ve been feeling pretty good for the last week or so, which is great. What’s not so great is that that probably means the Holter wouldn’t have picked up any irregularities. In any case I’m scheduled to go see the cardiologist again on Tuesday, so will update on that sometime in the middle of next week.</p>
<p>Hmm, the first tray of cookies is just out of the oven. Who wants one?</p>
