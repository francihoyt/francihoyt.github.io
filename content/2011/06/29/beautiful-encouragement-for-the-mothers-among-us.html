<p>One of my favourite authors and bloggers (<a href="/2011/02/07/loving-the-little-years/">I’ve raved about her before</a>) was invited by Desiring God ministries to write<a href="http://www.desiringgod.org/blog/posts/motherhood-as-a-mission-field?md5=5cd7b50d37565f2318bee0dac1a2eec8"> an article</a> for them. I found it very encouraging and helpful, and I hope all the mothers who visit this blog will read this article — you will not be sorry! Rachel’s writing is always like a fresh breath of air in a stale room because she is real about the struggles and yet there is no pity-parties — instead a clear pointer to Christ and the gospel. Go read it! :-)</p>
