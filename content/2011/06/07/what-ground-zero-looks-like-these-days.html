<p>I don’t think there would be anyone who doesn’t remember the shock they felt at the news of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. Since then, almost ten years have passed, and much has changed. Ground Zero is now a bustling construction site instead of a heap of rubble. When Ben’s dad was here, we went and had a look at the progress a bit closer up.</p>

<p>We see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center">One World Trade Center</a> every Sunday when we go to church, because it’s only a few blocks away from where we worship, and it’s been neat to see it rise higher over the last year.</p>

<p>You could see it in the distance <a href="/2011/06/03/did-i-tell-you-that-esther-is-now-walking/">in a recent blog post</a>, and I promised I’d show you some more photos of what Ground Zero looks like now, so here they are. There really isn’t all that much to see — it’s one great big construction site with big buildings being built. To see what it’s all meant to look like when it’s finished, <a href="http://www.wtc.com/">you can have a look at this website.</a></p>

<p>I look forward to seeing the progress of the One World Trade Center during our next year here. Apparently they hope to have the ‘<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topping_out">topping out</a>‘ of the tower late this year, so it will be interesting to see how the skyline changes as the tower grows.</p>
