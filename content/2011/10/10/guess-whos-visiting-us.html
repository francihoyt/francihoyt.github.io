<p>My parents! Right now I’m at home waiting for Ben to bring my parents home from the airport. We’re very excited to have them visit! We’re looking forward to taking a road trip with them while they’re here up to the Adirondacks, Niagara Falls and Pennsylvania. While they’re here for the rest of the month, blog posts may be a little patchy, so bear with me. :-)</p>
