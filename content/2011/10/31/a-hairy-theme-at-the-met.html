<p>Every time I go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art I see something I haven’t seen before, and I certainly go back to old favourites. Recently I took some photos with a hairy theme. Some of them are so ridiculous, you’d have to be an old stodge not to even get a slight smile at the lips. If you hover over the photo with your cursor you’ll see my captions for each photo.</p>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that I sometimes have a little fun with teasing great artworks. Take it as a sign that I enjoy it, rather than making an anti-art point. :-)</p>
