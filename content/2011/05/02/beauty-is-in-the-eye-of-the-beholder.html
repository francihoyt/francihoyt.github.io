<p>Marica said I looked beautiful after she was finished making me beautiful. Ben came home and called me hideous. I’ll let you decide for yourself!</p>
<p>It was cold and rainy a fair bit back in March, so one day when Marica asked if she could make me pretty, I consented. This carried on over a few days, with Esther getting involved too. Come on, have a good laugh at us!</p>
<p>Esther, ‘all pretty’.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00132.jpg"><img title="Esther prettified" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00132.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>Marica and Esther, ‘all pretty’.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00134.jpg"><img title="2 pretty girls" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00134.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Three femmes fatales!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00147.jpg"><img title="Fun" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00147.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Marica’s handiwork:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00151.jpg"><img title="beauty shot" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00151.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>But wait till you see the hair!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00152.jpg"><img title="Fabulous hair!" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00152.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>On another day, I let Esther put lipstick on me. (Thanks for the dark colour, Anna Banana, it took forever to wash off! :-) )</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00167.jpg"><img title="Esther's work" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00167.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And on yet another day, my hair got done. This happens pretty frequently (I don’t need much convincing to have people play with my hair!) around here.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00170.jpg"><img title="Pretty hair day" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00170.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And Marica got her hair done all pretty too.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00178.jpg"><img title="Marica's pretty hair" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00178.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p>Most of these photos were taken by Marica — she’s getting pretty good with the camera, don’t you think?</p>
<p>All this is even more funny because I used to do the same thing when I was a kid myself. I asked my mum to scan in these photos for me of when <em>I</em> was a little girl with with an obsession with lipstick!</p>

<p>If you have a little girl, and you have never played ‘making mummy pretty’, you need to get onto it! You’ll kill a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon and you’ll have years of giggles to follow.</p>
