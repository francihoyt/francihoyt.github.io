<p>As you can tell, I’m waaay behind on sight-seeing posts! When Hannah and Eva were here way back in March, we did quite a few fun things I haven’t shared here yet, so here’s a photo post of some of the things we did and ate! :-)</p>
<p>We went out to dinner at an Italian restaurant:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00251.jpg"><img title="Italian restaurant" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00251.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>We went to a dessert place in Park Slope called The Chocolate Room where they have amazing chocolate desserts:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00395.jpg"><img title="Chocolate room" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00395.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>

<p>We saw interesting things, like the Columbus Circle globe with Trump Tower in the background:</p>

<p>We went to the South Street Sea Port after church one Sunday, which has a great view of the Brooklyn Bridge:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00264.jpg"><img title="DSC00264" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00264.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>

<p>We visited Central Park and had some lunch there:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00230.jpg"><img title="DSC00230" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00230.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00231.jpg"><img title="Central Park lunc" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00231.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00223.jpg"><img title="Central Park skating rink" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00223.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00229.jpg"><img title="Marica loves dogs!" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00229.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>We went to Little Italy and had amazing little pastries. Yes, we all gained weight that week, I’m sure!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00215.jpg"><img title="In little italy" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00215.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>A small sample of some of the pastries available:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00212.jpg"><img title="Little Italy yummies" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00212.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>If anyone’s interested in going to Little Italy, let me know — I’m always up for this kind of thing! (Not to mention the cheese, salami, olive and bread shop across the road from this bakery. Oh my.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00210.jpg"><img title="more yummies" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00210.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And at Chelsea Market’s Anthropologie we girls admired this dress made out of paper and secretly wished we could wear something so outlandish. At least, <em>I</em> did!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00240.jpg"><img title="Cool dress" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00240.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>For some reason my camera was doing weird things while they were here and some of my photos turned out super over-exposed. I had fun playing with one of them, so here’s an over-exposed Eva for you. :-) I love the hair!</p>
