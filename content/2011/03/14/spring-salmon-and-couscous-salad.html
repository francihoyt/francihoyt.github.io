<p>I know that I’ve had a lot of recipes on here recently. Maybe that can partly be attributed to the weather — the more time we have inside, the more time I have to do fun stuff in the kitchen, plus it’s not so insanely hot when the oven goes on. Though for the recipe I want to share with you today, you don’t even need to switch on your oven.</p>
<p>This couscous salad would be great to take to a potluck, and is a nice light yet filling dinner. I got the recipe with a zester from a magazine subscription once. I’ve made a few changes, so here is the modified recipe for you. It’s worth making, trust me. The recipes says that you can substitute chicken for the salmon, and I guess you could, but I thought the salmon tasted pretty top-notch.</p>

1 clove garlic, chopped<br>
1/2 teaspoon cumin<br>
1 tablespoon olive oil</p>
<p><strong>Salad</strong></p>
<p>1 cup water<br>
1 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth<br>
450g boneless salmon fillet<br>
2 cups couscous<br>
2 cups baby spinach<br>
1/2 cup <span style="text-decoration:underline;">finely</span> chopped mint<br>
1/2 cup chopped parsley<br>
400g can of chickpeas<br>
1 cup frozen peas, thawed<br>
1/2 cup chopped dried apricots (optional)<br>
3/4 cup cashew nut pieces (optional)</p>
<p><strong>Dressing</strong></p>
<p>zest and juice of 1/2 orange<br>
zest and juice of 1 lemon<br>
1 teaspoon chilli flakes (optional)<br>
1/2 teaspoon cumin<br>
2 tablespoons olive oil<br>
salt &amp; pepper, to taste</p>
<p>1. Combine marinade ingredients in a shallow dish. Marinate salmon. Turn to cover.</p>
<p>2. Bring water and stock to the boil. In a large bowl, pour boiling water and stock over couscous. Cover and set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Combine dressing ingredients. Mix together well. Set aside.</p>
<p>4. To cook salmon, heat a non-stick pan over a high heat. Take salmon out of marinade and pan-fry about 3 minutes on each side, until salmon is cooked through. Add any left-over marinade. Let it sizzle for about 30 seconds. Romove from pan. Let it cool slightly, then flake.</p>
<p>5. Fluff couscous with a fork. Add all other salad ingredients, including flaked salmon. Mix together. add dressing and mix evenly through couscous.</p>
<p>ENJOY!</p>
<p>Just a little note: You’ll see in the photo that the mint I used was <em>not</em> finely chopped. While I really enjoy the flavour this gives, but Ben commented that he didn’t like the “stinging nettle leaves”. So chop them finely. :-)</p>
