<p>The crocuses are out! And some mini irises too. I hope to see some daffodils soon!</p>
<p>We spotted these cuties in Central Park last Saturday.</p>

<p>The past week and a half has been full and fun — we had Ben’s cousins, Hannah and Eva, staying with us for 10 days, and in there somewhere we had the Rose kids for 3 days too. Busy, busy, but fun! What does that mean for you? Some touristy posts again! Just a pity you can’t taste the Italian pastries too. :-)</p>
