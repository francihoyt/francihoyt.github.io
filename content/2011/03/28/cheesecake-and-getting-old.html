<p>Last Sunday (a week and a half ago, almost), I got another year older. It’s funny how birthday excitement has the tendency to wane as you get older! Though perhaps that’s not a good way for me to look at it — it would be better to think about being blessed with another year instead of having a hum-ho attitude of ‘oh, just another year’. Maybe birthdays can be more of a celebration of what God has done for us over the last year? I’m currently reading <em>One Thousand Gifts</em> by Ann Voskamp, and it’s GOOD. She talks at length about thankfulness — something I have much to learn about. It’s one of those books that might just change how I think about some things, for the better. I’ll do a review on it when I’ve finished reading!</p>
<p>Now onto some birthday info. :-) I got spoiled with a very nice breakfast of currant scones and a delicious fruit salad made by Eva (it was so nice to have Hannah and Eva still here for my birthday!). After breakfast we took the subway up to <a href="http://redeemer.com/">Redeemer Presbyterian</a> where we had the good providence (1 in 5 chance!) of seeing Tim Keller. He preached a good sermon about the Shepherd and the sheep. I was quite happy that we got to hear him ‘in person’ — he preaches just as clearly as he writes.</p>
<p>After that we headed home, I had a nice skype call with my parents and then made dinner. We had yummy Aussie Chicken (oh yeah!). It was a nice low-key day that I was glad to be able to spend with some extra family.</p>

<p>For a birthday cake, I made <a title="Cheesecake" href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chantals-New-York-Cheesecake/Detail.aspx">cheesecake</a> with <a title="Blueberry topping" href="http://www.marthastewart.com/recipe/blueberry-topping">blueberry topping</a>. Definitely worth trying! Though I should add that it does make a very big cake — so be sure to have lots of people to share it with if you make it!</p>

<p>So, a year older. But hopefully not only a year older but also a year maturer. :-) Or if that’s not the case, that’s my hope for the next year!</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks so much to all of you who sent birthday wishes and/or gifts — they were very much appreciated!</p>
