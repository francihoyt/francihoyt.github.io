<p>The outside of our house at the back is painted in a vivid blue. Iâ€™ve planted some zinnias in pots, and the colour contrast is great. I had some fun taking photos of a couple of flowers the other day.</p>
<p>I just love, love, love being able to do this kind of thing with my awesome new camera:</p>

<p>Just look at the cool texture of the wall in this next pic:</p>
