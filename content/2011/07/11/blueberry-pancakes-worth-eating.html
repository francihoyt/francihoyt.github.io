<p>Blueberries are in season now here in the States and they’re plentiful and cheap. They’re also ridiculously good for you, but that’s really beside the point — what matters is that they <em>taste</em> so good! It’s hard to believe that they can taste better in any way other than plain from the punnet, but these pancakes bring out the blueberry flavour very well and they melt in your mouth. I really should whip up a batch of these again. Soon. I got the <a href="http://tastykitchen.com/recipes/breakfastbrunch/pancakeswaffles/blueberry-buttermilk-pancakes-3/">original recipe here,</a> but I’ve modified a fair bit. But give credit where credit is due, right?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Blueberry Orange Pancakes</strong></span></p>
<p>Because blue and orange is a good combo.</p>
<p>2 1/2 cups flour<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
2 tablespoons sugar<br>
2 whole large eggs<br>
1 cup orange juice (preferably with pulp)<br>
1 cup plain yoghurt<br>
3 tablespoons melted butter<br>
1 cup blueberries</p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;color:#444444;font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;line-height:24px;">Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda into a bowl. Set aside. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, sugar, yoghurt, orange juice, and melted butter. Add the blueberries to the wet ingredients, then add the dry ingredients into the wet. Do not over-mix. </span><span style="font-size:16px;color:#444444;font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;line-height:24px;">Cook batter in a skillet over medium heat.</span></p>
<p>Serve topped with a bit of butter and some syrup (maple is amazing) and fresh blueberries.</p>
