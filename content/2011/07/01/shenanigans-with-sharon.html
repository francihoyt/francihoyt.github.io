<p>Ben’s cousin Sharon visited us over Memorial Weekend, and we had a lot of fun packing in as much sight-seeing as was practical! Here is some photographic evidence.</p>
<p>We walked the Brooklyn Bridge,</p>

<p>sat on cool seats on the way to the Ferry terminal,</p>

<p>walked through the Financial district,</p>

<p>and Wall Street (we even went inside Tiffany &amp; Co.!),</p>

<p>took the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty (it was a strangely hazy day),</p>

<p>and met Ben for dinner. Of this I forgot to take a photo.</p>
<p>Next day we went to Central Park and Times Square. At Times Square they had this cool sand sculpturing thing going on.</p>

<p>Proof that Sharon has experienced Times Square. It’s a crazy place, but fun!</p>

<p>We were so glad you could come and visit, Sharon! We really enjoyed getting to know you better and showing you around. Tankyoo cammagen!</p>
