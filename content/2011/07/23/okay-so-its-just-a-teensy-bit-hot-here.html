We have 3 fans going constantly too and that seems to help, but the back room (which was the lounge when you were here and is now the kids’ room) gets pretty stinkin’ hot nonetheless.</p>"

<p>You’ve probably heard about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/nyregion/in-new-york-a-wretchedly-hot-day-for-the-record-books.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=hot&amp;st=cse">the heat wave that has hit us here in the States</a>. It’s a steaming sauna — free! We seem to be spending time here when all the records strike. Record snow, record heat. That’s okay, we like experiencing all sorts of things! Just pray that our air conditioner and fans keep working. :-) Oh, and that if there’s a breeze, it doesn’t come from the river — we’ve had a few, uh, sulphurous days earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Thank goodness for playground sprinklers!</p>
