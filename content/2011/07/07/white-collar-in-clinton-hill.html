Fun to think that they were filming near you.  i read somewhere that they might do more filming in Brooklyn because there were too many gawkers/interferences to their filming in the upper west side area.</p>"

<p>Yesterday and today we’ve had film crews on our street and surrounding neighborhood shooting for the TV series WhiteCollar. It’s been really cool to see a little glimpse of what goes into a production like this — SO many trucks and people doing all sorts of things.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve never watched an episode of WhiteCollar, so I wasn’t getting excited about the actors, I was just excited to see all this happening right where we live!</p>
<p>(Disclaimer about the photos: I had my awesome new camera on the wrong settings (still need my L plate) and got some seriously over-exposed photos. Thanks to Picasa’s editing power I was able to make some of these photos at least view-able, but that’s why the colouring is a little funky. Just so you don’t blame the camera.)</p>

<p>We walked past their catering tent. We didn’t try to pretend we were crew members, though that would have been fun! It sure smelled good.</p>

<p>And yes, we even saw them filming. :-)</p>

<p>They were filming a scene that had something to do with the bald guy putting stuff in a wheelie bin outside that garage. Don’t ask, I don’t know!</p>

<p>Then The Suit guy arrived and walked to the back. He and Mr Bald guy were talking about something. Then a girl stormed out the front door. If you see that episode, give me a yell, I’d like to see it!</p>

<p>Hey, there’s got to be some perks to living here, right? Especially when you’ve got nowhere to park because of their army of trucks! :-)</p>
