It is so good to come home and read them after a busy day at work. They have become quite a highlight - when there is a notification in my inbox it is the first thing I turn to. I hope your garden bears much fruit (and many vegetables!)<br>\nLove to you all, Phillipa</p>"

Sadfully, I am still up during the night too but not as often as you I am sure.<br>\nJust a comment to keep you going Elrike.  And I agree too.  Really enjoy reading the blogs.  The garden looks great.  I don’t think it would matter what the size of your garden Franci, you would always make it look great.  Getting daffodils in your garden here.<br>\nLove Miriam</p>"

<p>We  are among the few privileged New Yorkers who have our own private backyard. Private as in access (no one else uses our backyard), not private in the sense that nobody can see us, because we certainly have plenty of window eyes all around!</p>
<p>Last year we moved into our place in July and I was so busy with getting the house settled that by the time I had time to think about the garden it was pretty much fall. So when this spring rolled around, I was determined to make our backyard pretty.</p>
<p>Down here you can see the space I’m working with, and in that picture things were just starting to grow.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0221.jpg"><img title="Our backyard" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0221.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And this is the other side. All up it’s probably about 45 square meters of backyard and thankfully that’s not all garden. :-)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0220.jpg"><img title="Our apartment" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0220.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>I love the ivy that grows over the fences and back wall — it just adds such a nice amount of green to it all.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0670.jpg"><img title="pretty ivy" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0670.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>So now I’ve got some flowers planted,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0632.jpg"><img title="start of a flower garden" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0632.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>some tomatoes doing their thing,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0684.jpg"><img title="tomato!" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0684.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>the few veggies are starting to look like a garden,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0654.jpg"><img title="Veggie garden of sorts" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0654.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I have glorious amounts of basil and parsley in my garden,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0681.jpg"><img title="herbs" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0681.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And I have <a href="/2011/07/02/photo-fun/">pretty zinnias in pots</a>.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/07/dsc_0679.jpg"><img title="red zinnia" src="/images/2011/07/dsc_0679.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>What more can a city girl ask for?!</p>
