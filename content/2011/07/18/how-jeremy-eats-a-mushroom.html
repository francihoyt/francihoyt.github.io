I was just catching up with her and got in some morning humor before work.  Especially enjoyed (though it’s hard to be choosy) “Sunday, my dear Blunday.”</p>"

<p>When we were visiting Jeremy in Philly, I made some grilled mushrooms on the barbecue with fresh parmesan, salt, pepper, butter and fresh mozzarella cheese, garnished with a fresh basil leaf. Are your mouths watering yet?! They were delicious. Jeremy, being not a fan of mushrooms, was brave enough to try one. Here’s what it looked like:</p>
<p>First bite:</p>

<p>Hmmm, do I like this?</p>

<p>No, I don’t think so! The texture is nasty.</p>

<p>But the flavours aren’t too bad…</p>

<p>Actually, who am I kidding?</p>

<p>What fun. :-)</p>
