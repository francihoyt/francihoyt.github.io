<p>As I mentioned a while back, I was anticipating a visit from a good old friend from Christchurch, Margaret Haverland. Today she is getting ready to leave, after almost 2 weeks here. What a blast it has been! We’ve done loads of sight-seeing here in New York, and then she took me and the girls on a week-long road trip through Pennsylvania, down to Washington D.C., through Baltimore and Philadelphia and back home on Sunday. While she has been here I’ve taken (quite literally) about a thousand photos. Don’t worry, I won’t post them all here. :-) But I will start with some of our site-seeing  photos in New York, and I might get Margaret to do a guest post if she gets a chance!</p>
<p>Margaret was introduced to the New York subway system pretty promptly.</p>

<p>We walked the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2250.jpg"><img title="Brooklyn Bridge!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2250.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p>We saw Wall Street and the New York stock exchange and walked down to take the Staten Island ferry to see Lady Liberty. I was busy keeping kids busy, so no recent photos of the Lady. I hear she hasn’t aged a bit since the last time we saw her.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2283.jpg"><img title="Margaret in front of the New York stock exchange" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2283.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>She did some toy shopping at the oldest toy store in the US for her kids.</p>

<p>She took a picture of us at a fountain in lower Manhattan, next to City Hall.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2266.jpg"><img title="Our little family, downtown Manhattan" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2266.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>Near City Hall and the fountain we also saw this interesting creation. What I think is cool is that the big shadow in the background looks like it belongs to this creation, but it’s actually the shadow of a big building opposite the street!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2269.jpg"><img title="Cool sculpture near City Hall" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2269.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>This is how Esther steers Ben. By the hair!</p>

<p>We took a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A quick trip, but a good one.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2336.jpg"><img title="Margaret on the steps of the Met" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2336.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>

<p>We saw this funny plaque on a bench in Central Park.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2393.jpg"><img title="Pretty self-explanitory" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2393.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We were serenaded by a group of swimmers in their Speedos (!) trying to raise money for some sort of trip or something in Central Park. It was funny, but a bit off. No money from us, sorry, boys!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2390.jpg"><img title="These goons serenaded me and Margaret in the hopes of raising some funds. They had no luck with us!" src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2390.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And of course no (longer) visit to Ben and Franci is complete without a visit to The Chocolate Room. It’s sort of a Mecca for chocolate lovers.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/09/dsc_2218.jpg"><img title="We visited The Chocolate Room." src="/images/2011/09/dsc_2218.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="674" /></a></p>
<p>I hope to post about our road trip soon, but you might have to give me a few days — I have a lot of stuff to catch up on!</p>
