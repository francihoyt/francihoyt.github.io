content = "<p>Franci,</p>\n<p>Aren’t us moms always berating ourselves?  We are never doing enough of something!  We don’t need people on the street to put us down…we just do it for them!;)  lol All that to say that you may feel you could use your time better as I’m sure we all do but might I encourage you that you do an AMAZING job and I was particularly inspired last week at your place by seeing all the artwork you do with Marica and I love it that a simple piece of paper that had been wrapped around flowers became drawing paper for Marica!  That is very smart thinking!</p>\n<p>Anyways, I don’t want to discourage you from using time more wisely as you feel so led but I would like to encourage you that you are doing a great job as a mom and as a wife.  You make a good, rich and beautiful home for your family!  If you were wasting too much of your time, I don’t think you would keep the home you do!:)</p>"

content = "<p>I tend to agree with Susanna but it was a good article. However I do think it would be interesting to see how much time is spent on consoling children or breaking up fights.  The witching hour would make quite an interesting dialogue.<br>\nPrepare Dinner. Break up fight, get back to preparing dinner, break up fight again, get back to dinner prep again, console child, discipline other child for being nasty to sibling, finish dina prep. Start tidying up before Hubby comes home from work, set table, retidy up toys…..</p>\n<p>yes well, better go make sure kids are behaving again, its getting quiet…..</p>"

<p>I often feel slightly frustrated at the seeming lack of time I have for doing things like reading, crafting or doing special fun things with the kids. Part of my lack of time is certainly due to the demands of daily life as a wife and a stay-at-home mother of two busy little people, but some of it is most certainly due to me wasting time.</p>
<p>Last week there was an<a href="http://www.thefrugalgirl.com/2011/01/prodctivity-frugal-girl-style-cut-schedule-clutter/"> excellent blog post on one of my favourite blogs about Time Clutter</a>. I found it to be a very good reminder to use my time wisely and spend it where my priorities lie, rather than my selfish lazy wants! I encourage you to read it and be encouraged and/or challenged too!</p>
<p>And so I’m probably off to go play another game of Hi Ho Cherry-O with Marica, or to have a tea party with her in the special fort she built. :-)</p>
