<p>In preparing our Christmas dessert I twice had to stop and take pictures because the food was so beautiful.</p>
<p>First up, just admire the beauty of butter, sugar and eggs creamed together:</p>

<p>And when you cook up a syrup of sugar, butter and water, you get pretty swirls!</p>

<p>If I had a picture of bread dough, I’d share it with you… that’s another happy occurrence in my kitchen.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but I love making, eating and sharing food!</p>
