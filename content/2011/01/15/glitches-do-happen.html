<p>For some reason our previous post about the happy occurrence of our 6th wedding anniversary had a few glitches — not the whole post I had done showed up, missing a kind of special part, and for some inexplicable reason comments were turned off (I’ve fixed that now). So, sorry ‘bout that.</p>
<p>The special part that was missing was a paragraph at the end. It read something like this:</p>
<p>Today we’re not celebrating our anniversary in any kind of special way. Why? Because we’re going to celebrate a bit … <em>later</em>. As in, <a href="http://www.oyster.com/dominican-republic/hotels/punta-cana-hotel/">by going on a little jaunt away without the kids to the Caribbean!</a></p>
<p>We can hardly believe it ourselves.</p>
