<p>Last Friday, a few friends from church met up at <a href="http://alicesteacup.com/">Alice’s Tea Cup</a> with their daughters for a fun, girly time of drinking tea, eating good food and some good conversation.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06642.jpg"><img title="Some of the girls" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06642.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Alice’s Tea Cup is definitely a girly tea room, decorated in pretty colours with cool chandeliers and fairy wings on the walls.</p>

<p>They also set the table with pretty china and Marica got to drink her Coke out of a wine glass!</p>

<p>Marica absolutely loved it there and was so determined that she didn’t want to go home that she hid under the coat rack when we were leaving, causing a little bit of panic among the adults who couldn’t find her anywhere for a few minutes!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/01/dsc06644.jpg"><img title="Marica loved it" src="/images/2011/01/dsc06644.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>

<p>Marica had some Coke and also an order of “Cookies and Milk” which was served in a pretty china plate and cup. (I was terrified of breakage, but the only thing that broke was a plain white jam container that Esther dropped on the ground!) I had a curried chicken sandwich with salad covered in The Most Amazing Salad Dressing Ever. I’ll go back there easily!</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.rickandsusanna.com/2011/01/break-from-the-ordinary.html">Susanna has done a blog post about it too</a>, so you can hop over to her blog and look at some more pictures!</p>
