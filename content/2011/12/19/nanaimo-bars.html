<p>Let me introduce you to a lovely piece of goodness. This little bite of joy is apparently a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanaimo_bar">Canadian treat</a>, and when I saw a recipe for it online some months back, I knew it would be something Ben would enjoy. Chocolate, nuts and coconut in the base, a sweet and smooth middle, and chocolate on top. Oh, it’s as good as it sounds. Actually, it’s better. And it is surprisingly not <em>sickly</em> sweet. Ben said it probably topped his old-time favourite, Country House Butterscotch Brownies, which says a lot. It’s called a Nanaimo Bar, and you should go make some. Soon.</p>
