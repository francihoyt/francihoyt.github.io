<p>I was going to start by saying that Esther turned two just last week. But then I realised that it would almost be more accurate to say she turned two just last <em>month. </em>Sometimes I feel disoriented with how fast time goes — my head is still two weeks ago and my body, by default, is here and now. It’s a strange feeling. But this post is about Esther, and her birthday.</p>
<p>There was the usual singing to the birthday girl and opening presents in pajamas.</p>

<p>The kids had a fun day. We didn’t really have any special celebration, but they had their much-loved music class in the morning, and afterward I took them to MacDonald’s for lunch. They got Happy Meals with tacky toys that they were absolutely thrilled about. I will quietly get rid of said tacky toys when they have been laying forgotten at the bottom of the toy box for a few weeks. But don’t tell them!</p>
<p>Special dinner was pizza and birthday cake. For both girls’ 2nd birthdays I have made plain chocolate cakes decorated by copious amounts of colourful candy and sprinkles, and it’s been a hit both times. The fancy cakes can wait until they’re old enough to appreciate them!</p>

<p>Esther wasn’t too interested in pizza — there was cake! I had to resort to hiding it on top of the kids’ dresser in their room so Esther would at least try the pizza.</p>

<p>My mum brought over some special birthday candles for the girls when she visited in October — the flame is the same colour as the candle. There was more excitement on Marica’s part than on Esther’s about this — Esther just loves flames, and blowing them.</p>

<p>And then cake the best part — eating the cake!</p>
