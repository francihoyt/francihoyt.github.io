And—wow—what an experience to go backstage and see all these people in person and get signed ballet shoes!!!  That will be a lasting memory, I hope.  So glad two of you got to take that in.  I’d gotten rather tired of the Nutcracker…too many indifferent Knoxville performances as a school child and too many piano recitals where we played pieces from the ballet—sometimes duets…but this renewed my interest in it.  The Sugar Plum Fairy was amazing!</p>"

<p>Last weekend our friend Megan, who dances in the <a href="http://www.nycballet.com/nycb/home/">New York City Ballet</a>, gave us two tickets to attend <em>The Nutcracker</em> ballet at the Lincoln Centre, and Ben took Marica to go watch her dance.</p>
<p>Marica was of course very excited to be able to go!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_4993-large.jpg"><img title="Marica in her seat" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_4993-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The company performs in the lovely David H. Koch theatre at the Lincoln Centre.</p>

<p>Ben said the dancing was really spectacular (and when the Christmas tree grew, it was gigantic — about 8 metres around at the base). You’re not allowed to take photos of the performance, but Megan invited them backstage after the performance.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5016-large.jpg"><img title="Impressive lighting" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5016-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>Megan danced the part of “Coffee from Arabia” (a stunning solo dance set to almost haunting music that was very familiar, says Ben).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5000-large.jpg"><img title="Marica and Megan" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5000-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>

<p>They got to see the ‘snow’. Looking at this picture makes it look just like a <em>little</em> bucket full of paper pieces.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/12/dsc_5010-large.jpg"><img title="Snow" src="/images/2011/12/dsc_5010-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>But this photo shows you the size of it. And there were about 4 of them!</p>

<p>They also got to see some of the other ballet dancers.</p>

<p>I thought the photo above would look cool cropped and in B&amp;W, and here’s the result:</p>

<p>Another one of Megan with Marica.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Megan signed her ballet shoes and gave them to Marica as a momento of this very special day.</p>
