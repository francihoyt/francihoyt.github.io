<p>A while back we girls had a fun afternoon of doing each other’s hair. I made Marica’s hair into a triple braid.</p>

<p>She was studiously doing her schoolwork while I took photos of her hair!</p>

<p>It was a neat coincidence that we attended the wedding of friends from church the next day, and her hair looked really nice out all curly!</p>

<p>The wedding was at really beautiful grounds. Here the kids are on a bridge looking down at the world’s fattest fish.</p>
