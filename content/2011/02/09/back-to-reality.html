<p>This past weekend Ben and I flew off into the Tropical sunset and had a total blast. We came back on Monday night and since then we’ve been right back into things here. I wasn’t organised enough to have self-publishing posts past Monday’s post on here, and things have been busy since we’ve been back, so you’ll all have to wait a little while till Friday to hear all about our trip and see a whole bunch of photos.</p>
<p>In the mean time, here’s a little teaser. :-)</p>
