content = "<p>Marica’s sure a pro at that pose…perfectly matched angle of their right arm!  (Maybe next halloween you could dye an old sheet for her to trail around in.)  Love Esther’s matching aqua coat in the photo of her “walking.”  And the one of her crawling into history.  I tried several times to get photos of either of them in that museum, but they had usually moved by the time my flash was ready to go off.  Should organize my photos (and delete all the blurry duplicates).</p>"

<p><strong>The New Colossus </strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:15px;font-size:small;">By Emma Lazarus, 1883</span></p>
<p>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,<br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;<br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand<br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame<br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name<br>
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand<br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command<br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.<br>
“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she<br>
With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,<br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,<br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.<br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,<br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”</p>

<p>When Hannah and Eva were visiting us, we went to Liberty Island to see Lady Liberty a bit closer than just passing by on the Staten Island Ferry <a href="/2010/06/28/the-statue-of-liberty/">like we have done before</a>. It was really neat to be able to see some more detail and to be able to go up into the pedestal.</p>
<p>When you see her in the distance, she looks so small, but when you get close she is really pretty imposing!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00328.jpg"><img title="Hannah and Eva" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00328.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="597" /></a></p>
<p>And when something is imposing, that means of course that you have do some posing!</p>

<p>Esther did some walking practice but she’s still not walking!</p>

<p>And a token family photo.</p>

<p>This little ratbag sure cutes me out!</p>

<p>We went through 2 airport-style security checks that day (our annoyance levels were pretty high by the end of the second one!) but eventually got to go up into the pedestal. There was a little museum in there about her history. I won’t tell you about all that now, instead I’ll just show you some pictures. :-)</p>
<p>Esther crawling back into history:</p>

<p>Marica sitting on an actual sized replica of the Lady’s foot:</p>

<p>Manhattan taken from the pedestal. The building under construction that’s about the height of those around it already is the One World Trade Centre that they are rebuilding. And it’s only about halfway done! Another blog post coming on that soon.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00366.jpg"><img title="Manhattan from The Lady" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00366.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And you can even see the Empire State Building and midtown in the distance.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00359.jpg"><img title="Lady's view of Manhattan" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00359.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Brooklyn from the pedestal. We live pretty close to that distinct building in the middle.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00362.jpg"><img title="Lady's view of Brooklyn" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00362.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>What the Lady looks like on the inside:</p>

<p>Maybe this is what Lady Liberty would look like if she were your mother and you were a little toddler?</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2011/03/dsc00361.jpg"><img title="Unusual view" src="/images/2011/03/dsc00361.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>I guess you seldom see The Lady’s back, so I’ll leave you with something a little different.</p>
