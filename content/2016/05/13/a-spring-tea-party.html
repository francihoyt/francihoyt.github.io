content = "<p>Hurray for new traditions involving tea!  I’ve enjoyed using the two teapots I have when friends have come over and all opted for tea instead of coffee.  If you were here longer, they could certainly make a useful appearance this weekend!  Glad we’ll be seeing you soon!</p>"

content = "<p>Hi Franci,</p>\n<p>Very pretty!  and it’s lovely to do now that your girls are old enough  to appreciate fine things.</p>\n<p>I suggested this idea to Ilse for her birthday too, but it didn’t work  out with the timing/friends in the end - maybe next year!  She  definitely likes prettiness and elegance as well.</p>\n<p>Love, Laurel</p>"

<p>In our living room stands a beautiful wooden display cabinet that has been in my family for 3 generations. It displays a selection of pretty tea cups, teapots, milk pitchers and sugar pots I have been given from my grandma, my mum, and Ben’s grandma Tschetter. I love them all, but they’re of course too pretty and special to use on a regular basis… with the end result that they never get used! This is a problem that needed a solution.</p>
<p>So I organized a tea party with some friends! And what better reason to get a bunch of girls together to drink tea out of pretty cups than springtime? The first weekend of April we got together over some lovely food (contributed by everyone), a vast selection of teas and tea pots (some people also brought theirs to share) and had a lovely, lovely time chatting and forgetting a bit about everything else.</p>
<p>I think we just started a new tradition!</p>
