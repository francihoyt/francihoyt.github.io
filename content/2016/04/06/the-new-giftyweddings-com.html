<p>Most of you know that I (this is Ben posting for a change) run a little wedding gift registry website called <a href="https://giftyweddings.com/">GiftyWeddings.com</a>. It’s been going for almost eight years now, helping several couples every month create nice simple gift registries that aren’t tied to a particular store.</p>
<p>The design of the site was never exactly stellar (being designed by yours truly), but with bigger computer screens (and smaller phones!) it had started to look pretty dated:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/04/old-gifty1.png" alt="old-gifty.png" width="1347" height="681" /></p>
<p>I do like old-school, but … it was definitely time for an update.</p>
<p>So I’ve spent the last couple of months of bus commutes rebuilding the site: a new design, new implementation, new server, and new payment system. Here’s what it looks like now:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="https://giftyweddings.com"><img src="/images/2016/04/new-gifty.jpg" alt="new-gifty" width="1351" height="673" /></a></p>
<p>Complete with a fun photo of my wife going down a flying fox (zip-line) in her wedding dress.</p>
<p>So I’m a bit biased, but I think it’s an improvement. And the user interface is also significantly nicer, and works well on mobile phones — great for when your guests are out shopping for your wedding gift and want to cross an item off using their phone.</p>
<p>So if you know someone who’s getting married, please help our small, family-owned side business and point them to <strong><a href="https://giftyweddings.com">GiftyWeddings.com</a></strong>. :-)</p>
<p>If you’re of a nerdy bent and want to know what tools I used to build the new site, this list is for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> for the backend (version 3.4)</li>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> running the server</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> for the database</li>
<li><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> web framework</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee">peewee</a> ORM</li>
<li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> and JavaScript powering the frontend</li>
<li><a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for payments</li>
</ul>
<p>I have good things to say about all those tools. React was new for me and a good experience. Stripe Checkout is an amazingly simple service to set up — highly recommended.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://giftyweddings.com/contact">contact me</a> if you have any feedback about the new site!</p>
