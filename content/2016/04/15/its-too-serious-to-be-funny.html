content = "<p>Thankfully not purporting in any way to be Christian, but I had a similar “Whoa, what’s that?” moment in a link advertised at a recent cello recital. (The recital itself was being promoted by Ilse’s cello teacher, though she has none of these religious leanings!)  Check this out:<br>\nhttps://goldenagementor.co.nz/raoul-pierard-soul-sound-portraits/<br>\nEstelle did not fail to note the irony that this link featured on one side of the recital programme, and on the other side was a listing of Bach’s six solo cellos suites that were featured along with a Bach portrait and the inscription “To the greater glory of God”!</p>"

<p>I’ve been searching for a preschool for Laurelin for a couple of mornings a week. I think it’ll be good for her, and it will help the two older girls and me get a bit more done in school. It’s either that or a very part-time nanny, but I’ve just started looking so we’ll see.</p>
<p>Anyway, in my search, I came across a preschool that uses a church’s facilities (but they’re not affiliated with them at all). Ben and I scrolled through the church’s page and photos to get an idea of what they believe, etc. out of interest and came across this one. No, I don’t know the context, and each to his own, but…?!</p>
