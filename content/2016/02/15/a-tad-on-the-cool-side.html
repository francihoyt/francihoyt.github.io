Had to leave the girls to empty and defrost it, hoping that fixed the problem.  It behaved, for a few days - then went on strike again.  Can’t get a serviceman for over a week, so we’re hoping it holds out just a little longer!</p>"

<p>This past weekend was a little nippy. I’d say it was the coldest weather we’ve ever experienced! Most of last week the high during the day didn’t get above 0°C, and by Sunday morning we woke up to this (my phone shows temperature in Celsius):</p>

<p>Ben and I were hoping we’d get to the sweet spot where Celsius and Fahrenheit meet (-40). It got close, but not quite. :-)</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.7;">The high yesterday (Sunday) got up to -17°C. </span></p>

<p>To add a little excitement to the mix, our heating system at church stopped working after a while, so our second service was quite cool.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week I noticed a problem with our heating system at home, so I got someone in to fix that. The humidifier part of the system had completely packed up and was dripping water in all sorts of places it shouldn’t. Thankfully it was all fixed before this cold weekend!</p>
<p>I’m very glad that this kind of weather is an “event”, and not a regular occurrence where we live!</p>
