<p>Back in June, some folks in our church (MeRF = <a href="http://merfnyc.org/">Messiah’s Reformed Fellowship</a>) headed out to Pennsylvania for a getaway at Kirby House, a beautiful old house that was once used by the Kirby family as their summer home in the mountains.</p>

<p>It was really great to spend some decent time with church folks. Our church is a commuter church so most of our fellowship times happen on Sundays because it is so difficult to get together during the week. So, having a weekend to spend time together was great. I didn’t take many photos, which is a shame because the grounds are gorgeous, but I was spending time with people instead.</p>
<p><img title="I handed my camera off to someone else to take the real photo -- this one was me getting the settings right -- but the &#x27;real&#x27; photo didn&#x27;t turn out, so this is the best I&#x27;ve got!" src="/images/2016/08/dsc_0655-large.jpg" alt="DSC_0655 (Large)" width="1490" height="1080" /></p>
<p>We had some good talks led by Pastor Murphy, time for swimming and walks, and just hanging out enjoying each other’s company. We also had a talent evening, which was fun!</p>
