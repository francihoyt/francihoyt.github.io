<p>A couple of years ago, I really enjoyed reading through <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Gift-Unwrapping-Story-Christmas/dp/1414387083/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478995212&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+greatest+gift">The Greatest Gift</a></em> by Ann Voskamp for Advent. This year I’m trying to be organized enough to remind you that if this is something you’d like to buy, now’s a good time, with Advent being just two weeks away and all! This is not a sponsored post or anything, I just really loved to book and wanted to share it with you guys!</p>

<p>I don’t have the ornaments that go with the devotional, nor will I have time in the foreseeable future to make any, but that doesn’t detract from the book at all, in case any of you were wondering!</p>
