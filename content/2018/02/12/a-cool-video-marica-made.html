<p>Marica has been taking photos of everyday beauty (mostly during our time in NZ), editing them, and has turned them into a nice little video, which I’d like to share with you below. Proud Mama moment!</p>

<p>Incidentally, today is also her birthday. Her <em>eleventh</em>. Which, while we’re sharing videos, makes me want to share <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clcNB_EUao8">this beautiful song</a>.</p>
