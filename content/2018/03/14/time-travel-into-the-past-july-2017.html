<p>Life’s been happening by the spade full around here, and blogging has been severely neglected, sorry. Here’s an attempt at rectifying that!</p>
<p>Back in July last year… hmmm, let’s see if the photos can remind me that far back!</p>
<p>There was the joy of growing veggies in the backyard,</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170627_094726102.jpg" alt="IMG_20170627_094726102" width="3264" height="1836" /><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170627_094747088.jpg" class="portrait" alt="IMG_20170627_094747088" width="1836" height="3264" /> a great visit from Ben’s dad and a picnic table built by him and Ben,</p>

<p>and many pool days, including a fun 4th of July celebration at my friend Kelly’s house that involved a crazy greased watermelon game. It’s kind of like rugby but with a watermelon slickly greased with Crisco, and in the water!</p>

<p>Marica went off to a 5-night sleep-over summer camp with her friend Willow, and loved it,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2018/03/img_20170716_161125062_hdr.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170716_161125062_hdr.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2018/03/img_20170721_181448896.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170721_181448896.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2018/03/img_20170716_161106901_hdr.jpg"><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170716_161106901_hdr.jpg"></a></p>

<p>and while Marica was at camp and Laurelin at preschool, I took Esther for a fun mom and daughter pedicure, which was a real nice treat!</p>

<p>There were also plenty of park days,</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170715_130308653.jpg" alt="IMG_20170715_130308653" width="3264" height="1836" /></p>
<p>beautiful sunsets,</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170703_204239476_hdr.jpg" alt="IMG_20170703_204239476_HDR" width="3264" height="1836" /></p>
<p>a fun picnic with a sister church out on Long Island,</p>
<p><img src="/images/2018/03/img_20170715_181726201.jpg" alt="IMG_20170715_181726201" width="3264" height="1836" /></p>
<p>and plenty of hilarity — that is dirt she sat in outside while playing with mud, not poop, I promise! Why my kids seem to think that playing with dirt in white clothing is okay is beyond me. See also the crazy sister in the background about to do a roly-poly on the tile floor. Did I mention hilarity? :-)</p>
