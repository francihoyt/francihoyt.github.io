Eva and I loved looking into a couple of the Le Pain Quotidien; I can’t remember if we ever bought something there, but I think so.  How was Once?  Sounds like a wonderful visit.</p>\n<p>Alexander, SMILE!</p>"

content = "<p>Once is a cute love story, and I liked that. I also really liked the bluegrass music. What I didn’t like was the overuse of Jesus’ name as a cussword. It was so unneccessary and really spoiled an otherwise fun show for me.</p>"

<p>In June, we had a lovely visit from Ben’s Uncle Walter, Aunt Nelda and cousin Alexander from Texas. They were here for 4 days and we got a really good amount of sight-seeing done with them, balanced by a nice lot of calmly visiting at home.</p>
<p>We took them to our favourite touristy spot near our house where you can get a fantastic view of Manhattan from across the river.</p>

<p>The girls enjoyed rolling down the little grassy bank there.</p>

<p>There is a war memorial near the look-out and it tickled my funny bone that it had been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarn_bombing">yarn-bombed</a>, quite likely for Memorial Day or the 4th of July (we were sort of in-between both).</p>

<p>We took the Baneks to see a few NYC sights, and of course the Brooklyn Bridge featured on the list!</p>

<p>Lunch at Le Pain Quotidien was delightful, followed by a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

<p>From there Ben and Uncle Walter took the kids home and Aunt Nelda, Alexander and I went to see St Bartholomew’s Church where there were stained glass windows she wanted to see.</p>

<p>Thanks for making us one of the stops on your roadtrip, Baneks! We really enjoyed our time with you.</p>
