<p>Marica and Esther started piano lessons the week after our piano arrived, and have both been enjoying it a lot, no doubt because of their excellent teacher (who also happens to be our friend!), <a href="http://www.murphypianostudio.com/">Shannon Murphy</a>.</p>
<p>For the end of year recital (end of the academic year) Marica performed two of her pieces that she’d learned. It was pretty soon after starting, given the fact that we got our piano in April and the academic year ends in June, but she did really well! And get this — they had the recital at Steinway Hall! Wow. It’s pretty cool to say you’ve performed at Steinway Hall!</p>

<p>Marica really enjoys learning piano, and not a day goes by that she doesn’t practice or tinker around playing things by ear. She’s figured out how to play plenty of songs just by having heard them.</p>

<p>Well done, Marica! We’re proud of you!</p>

<p>I got a cute photo of the three sisters on a pretty seat in front of the recital room beforehand.</p>
