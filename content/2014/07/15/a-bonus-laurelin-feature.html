<p>This post is specially for grandparents, aunties and other such doting people who would be interested in these videos of our little Lorax.</p>
<p>Marica loves to play rough and tumble with Laurelin, but she’s very careful not to be too rough. Laurelin <em>loves</em> Marica!</p>

<p>And, saving the best for last: Laurelin is now officially a toddler, preferring walking over crawling. Please pass me the tissues!</p>
