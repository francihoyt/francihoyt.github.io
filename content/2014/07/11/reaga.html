<p>Reaga is a mix between reading and yoga. Marica has invented it without even knowing!</p>
<p>The other day I was sitting at the computer doing stuff when I saw something out of the corner of my eye that didn’t look quite right. There she was, quite casually just lying there in <em>that position </em>reading her book. She was like that for quite a while too!</p>
