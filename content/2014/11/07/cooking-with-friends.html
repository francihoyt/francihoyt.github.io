<p>When I was in high school, a woman in our church (hi, Jantina!) got a bunch of us young’uns together for a day of cooking at her house. She gave us some basic recipes and tips and together we spent the day cooking and baking. Such a simple thing, but I remember that day very fondly and with much gratitude. I always thought I’d like to do something like that too, one day when I was a grown-up. And then I realized that, actually, I’m already a grown up, and I can do this now!</p>
<p>The nature of the church we attend in New York is that people come from all over the metropolitan NYC area, and we are very spread out. It really limits the contact we have with each other during the week, so whenever we get together it is great.</p>
<p>This was no exception. I wasn’t exactly teaching new skills to young’uns, because we’re all pretty close in age, but it was really fun just cooking together with a bunch of girls, to have an excuse to use my pretty tea cups (though looking at the photos now I notice that my table sorely lacked a tablecloth!) to drink tea of various sorts and eat the fruits of our labors.</p>

<p>Esther and Marica did a bit of helping too. Here Esther is chopping mushrooms, which was very nice of her because she detests them!</p>

<p>We made made bread and soup and a very nice dinner. It was a great team effort!</p>

<p>And that reminds me, I should get my act together and start planning our next cooking day!</p>
