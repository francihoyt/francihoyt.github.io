Maybe I can make it to Franci’s Hobbit coming of age?  Eva and I are still hoping to do some travel around the time of hers, since we didn’t make it back to NZ for my 33rd and her 30th—it had been a dream we had.</p>"

<p>As everyone knows — well, at least everyone who’s a fan of Tolkien — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Appearance">a hobbit comes of age at 33</a>. I turned this ripe old age the other day, and had a fabulous party, mostly organized by Franci, my lovely hobbit-wife.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2014/08/dsc_0998-large-e1407461064104.jpg"><img src="/images/2014/08/dsc_0998-large-e1407461064104.jpg" alt="No Admittance Except on Party Business" width="450" height="355" /></a></p>
<p>We had some great, down-to-earth hobbit food cooked by Franci with some help from Lillian: loads of mushrooms (fried in butter), homemade bread rolls with “Beorn’s” creamed honey and butter, Mum’s meatloaf (“dwarvish meatloaf”), punch (“Miruvor”), ale from The Green Dragon, “Sauron’s eyeballs” deviled eggs, and lots of other yummy things I’m forgetting.</p>

<p>I wrote a little speech that kind of paralleled Bilbo’s speech at his “eleventy-first” birthday party (and Frodo’s 33rd). There were a couple of <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-based games and riddles.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2014/08/dsc_0999-large-e1407463167642.jpg"><img src="/images/2014/08/dsc_0999-large-e1407463167642.jpg" alt="Gandalf quote" width="640" height="491" /></a></p>
<p>There was a small crowd of maybe 15 mostly from church and a couple from work. A few people even dressed up.</p>

<p>In true Hobbit-fashion, Franci and I organized and wrapped gifts for each of the guests (though there were no silver spoons).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2014/08/dsc_0996-large.jpg"><img src="/images/2014/08/dsc_0996-large.jpg" alt="Gifts for the guests" width="640" height="425" /></a>All in all, a fun time! I highly recommend a Hobbit coming-of-age party for your next trend-setting event. :-)</p>
