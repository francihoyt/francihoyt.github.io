content = "<p>… and here we were, just learning in OUR homeschooling studies about octopuses last week, that the correct plural is “octopuses”.  Shaken to the core. :-)  However, I see from consulting on-line dictionaries that Marica is also correct!</p>"

<p>I was folding washing this morning listening to Marica and Esther talk, and just had to share this funny:</p><p>E: “Mawica, dose are nithe octoputheth.”</p><p>M: “They aren’t octopuses, they’re decorations!</p><p>E: “Dey look like octoputheth…”</p><p>M: “They’re decorations, NOT octopi!”</p>
