<p>Marica and I went to the <a href="http://lsc.org/">Liberty Science Center</a> in Jersey City last Saturday to see their new Rubik’s Cube exhibition, which was being opened by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ern%C5%91_Rubik">Ernő Rubik</a>, the inventor of the cube. I own a cube, but still have no idea how to solve it…</p>
<p>Mr Rubik seemed like a fairly unassuming guy with a mild Eastern European accent. We are more or less celebrities by association now, as we got to see his back — he’s the guy in the blue shirt:</p>

<p>Reuters has a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/video/2014/04/24/erno-rubik-celebrates-the-40th-anniversa?videoId=312716863">short article and video clip</a> in case you’re interested in further info.</p>
<p>Marica wasn’t fussed on Mr Rubik and the crowds, but she did enjoy some of the rest of the exhibit, including “programming” a robot to follow a line:</p>
