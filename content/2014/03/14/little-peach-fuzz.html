<p>It’s so much fun to have a baby in the house! (Especially now that I’m getting more sleep.)</p>

<p>Laurelin is the cause of many laughs, hugs and smiles.</p>

<p>Her sisters dote on her (and so do her parents!).</p>

<p>Her hair seems to be growing in a way that defies gravity. We call her Little Peach Fuzz because of it.</p>

<p>Laurelin doesn’t like being alone — I guess that’s part and parcel of being the 3rd child!</p>

<p>She’s just too dang cute!</p>
