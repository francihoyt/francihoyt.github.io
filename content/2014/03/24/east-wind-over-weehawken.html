It’s called “From the mixed-up files of Mrs Basil E Frankweiler” by E L Konigsburg.</p>"

<p>The other night we had our temporary landlord over for dinner and as well as having a lovely time, we also found out a bit about some of the art around here. The big painting in the dining room is a replica of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Storm_(painting)">The Storm</a></em> by Pierre Auguste Cot.</p>

<p>We should go check it out at the Met sometime!</p>
<p>Another very interesting thing we found out was that a painting by Edward Hopper that depicts this house sold at Christie’s last year for $36 million ($40.5 million with fees!). It’s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Wind_Over_Weehawken">East Wind Over Weehawken</a> and was painted during the Depression.</p>
