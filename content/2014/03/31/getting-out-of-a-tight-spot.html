<p>The other day Ben and I were walking along when we spotted a car that had been <em>very</em> tightly parked in.</p>
<p>The back:</p>

<p>Lo and behold, imagine our disbelief and glee when we see the person whose car it is come along and get in the car <em>and proceed to get out of the spot</em>!</p>
<p>Here is a video clip of it for your enjoyment. Excuse the shaky hand!</p>
