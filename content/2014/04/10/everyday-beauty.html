<p>It’s so easy to become complacent, to not notice the beauty around us.</p>
<p>The beauty in the messes of little kids, because those kids are kids you love, and because they won’t be little forever.</p>
<p>Pretty flowers.</p>
<p>Happy lovers, bowed with age, taking a shuffling walk together — one hand holding a cane, the other holding the hand of their love.</p>
<p>A stranger offering a seat on a crowded bus.</p>
<p>A child who grasps a new learning concept.</p>
<p>The smell of a freshly ironed shirt.</p>
<p>A cozy fire.</p>
<p>The beauty of a baby enjoying her food.</p>

<p>The beauty of dad coming home.</p>
<p>(I took this video simply to have a record of how Laurelin enjoyed her meat, but then in the process captured a lovely glimpse into the kids’ running around and their excitement at seeing Ben’s bus stop across the road and him coming home.)</p>
