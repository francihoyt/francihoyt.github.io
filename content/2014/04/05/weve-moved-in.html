<p>Just a quick note to let you all know that we’ve moved into our new apartment where we hope to be for the next year (or more) in Jersey City Heights. We moved in on Monday and it’s been a bit of a shambles around here that is slowly turning into order. We don’t have much in the way of furniture until our container from New Zealand arrives, but on Friday our new living room set was delivered. How wonderful it felt to sit on soft chairs again! We had Ben’s cousin Hannah staying with us Wednesday and Thursday nights for a lovely quick visit, and I think she appreciated sitting on our new couches for about an hour too and having a break from sitting on the floor!</p>
<p>Now we eagerly wait for our container to arrive — it’s ETA in the country is on the 7th of this month, but then it could be 1-4 weeks until we get it depending on how long it is in quarantine and whether or not it has to go through some sort of customs exam. I <em>really </em>hope for sooner rather than later!</p>
<p>The apartment is a really great size. We have two floors, ground level and a first storey. Downstairs is the laundry, a bathroom and one big open room that I’m planning on turning into a playroom/schoolroom/guestroom. Upstairs are the bedrooms, two more bathrooms (who needs 3 bathrooms?!) and the living area. We also get a parking space, which is wonderful. Unfortunately there is no yard to speak of, but there is a really nice big park about 10 minutes walk away where Ben has taken the kids this morning.</p>
<p>It’s been nice to get out a bit more with the weather warming up a teensy bit. We’re looking forward to being able to go out again without multiple layers!</p>
