content = "<p>Haha yep it’s pretty bizarre all right! Very cool and super amazing and a little bit weird all at the same time :-) Even though it’s all happening inside me I often wonder at how little I really have to do with the whole process. I just eat and sleep and do my thing like usual and stuff happens! God’s creation is amazing. And I can’t thank you enough for the change table!!! It’ll see another round of service getting poo’d and pee’d on, and by the looks of it will have more than enough life in it to go to yet another happy home after that!</p>"

<p>Oops… that must have been the longest 48 hours in the history of the world. And I know you’re all just bursting to know the answer to the riddle. (Not!)</p>
<p class="indented"><em>What can see light but has never seen the sun;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>What lives in water but cannot swim;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>What can hear but cannot speak;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>When it moves it cannot be heard.</em></p>
<p>Well, a baby in the womb, of course! And no, before you jump to any conclusions this is NOT some sort of announcement. Just to make it clear in case you missed it: we are NOT expecting a baby. (Thanks, Uncle Walter.)</p>
<p>You see, my mind was simply wandering around as I sat nursing Laurelin. I looked over at my handy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bfhoyt/385205635/in/set-72157594527303020">change table</a> my dad designed and built for me and was thinking that I was sad to leave it behind, but glad it was going to the good home of our friends Hilly and Lesley. Then I thought of Lesley and how cool it is that she’s expecting, and then my thoughts got a little more abstract and I thought about how bizarre it is that she’s carrying another human around in a bag of water <i>inside herself.</i> It’s like science fiction! And that’s when I thought up the riddle. It was just intended to be for the kids and Ben around the dinner table, but here you go. :-)</p>
