<p>Last night I was sitting down and my mind thought up a riddle all by itself. It’s useful like that. See if you can figure it out:</p>
<p class="indented"><em>What can see light but has never seen the sun;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>What lives in water but cannot swim;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>What can hear but cannot speak;</em></p>
<p class="indented"><em>When it moves it cannot be heard.</em></p>
<span style="line-height:1.5;">I’ll tell you the answer in 48 hours (plus or minus a few)!</span>
