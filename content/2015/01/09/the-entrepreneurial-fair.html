We had a similar fair here for homeschoolers to share their wares … I opted to not notice this one as December was already chaotically full.</p>\n<p>We did make our usual peppernuts though.  :-)  And Ilse and Estelle made some money busking (lucrative) and onion picking with Conrad too (hard work but Conrad was super-fast!)</p>"

content = "<p>I wouldn’t have had any trouble buying those gingerbread men either, especially matching the plates so well! Good on all of you.</p>\n<p>Now in that last photo of Marica I’m sure I suddenly saw Hannah in Marica’s face - eyes especially, not the lower half. I really must be getting old, always “seeing someone else” in a grandchild’s photo. I never used to be like this, so you better not assume there is much to my opinions about who might look like whom.</p>\n<p>Love, Mum</p>"

<p>The Co-op that we attend had an Entrepreneurial Fair early in December, and as much as I would have liked to just be a spectator, my kids were burning to sell stuff (surprise, surprise). So, we made Christmas ornaments, some chocolates and gingerbread men. The girls made a pretty good effort at helping, and at selling on the day too. I was so proud of them!</p>

<p>The girls made $36 and sold all their cookies — good work, Marica and Esther!</p>
