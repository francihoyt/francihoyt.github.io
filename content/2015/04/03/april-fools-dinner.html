<p>A few years back, on a whim, I decided to start a fun tradition for April Fool’s Day dinner: dessert for dinner (and no need to have dinner for dessert!). Turns out the kids think this is great, but the adults give a little groan at the thought. So this year, I decided to make waffles, and everyone could have any topping on it they liked — if they wanted all the toppings, that was fine too, so long as they ate it! For Ben and me I had some grated cheese and fried mushrooms too, and in the end the kids all had a cheese version too.</p>

<p>As for tricks… by the time we were done with school, it was already mid-afternoon, and I had to scramble to get a few things going. I colored the toilet water, put tape over the bathroom tap so they’d get sprayed, and I sewed their pajamas shut. Esther was very confused: “Mum, look at my pajamas! Who did that?!” So cute.</p>
