<p>On a lovely warm day back in October, the girls and I took a field trip to a farm about an hour’s drive from where we live to go apple and pumpkin picking. The weather was fantastic — it was nice and sunny and not too hot or cold, a real Goldilocks kind of day. We took the drive out, and when we got there figured out which of the many activities on offer we wanted to do. We checked out the farm animals first and fed the donkey and goats a bag of carrots which I thought would last a long time and actually only took about a minute for them to munch!</p>

<p>After a little morning snack we went and did the corn maze. The kids were so excited, and it was good for their map-reading skills too. The older two would probably have been able to do the adult corn maze without too much trouble, but Laurelin needed carrying even through the kiddy one, and I didn’t really want to be carrying her for an hour while getting claustrophobic in a big corn maze!</p>

<p>After the corn maze, we went on a hayride to the orchards to go pick apples.</p>

<p>We got two whole boxes full of apples, and I was glad when someone offered us their little wagon. Then we could load some kids and apples on there and get around a little easier! Marica was pretty keen to pull them and she did a good job… until it got a little hard. :-)</p>

<p>Then it was on to the pumpkin patch where they make it very easy for you to pick your pumpkins — no prickly vines! They’re all just lying there, easy to choose which ones to take home. We got a whole bunch of them with the intention to carve them… right now they’re still sitting in our dining room, slowly going rotten. Oops.</p>

<p>It was a pretty tiring walk back to the main area, but we did eventually make it and had lunch before heading home again. What fun!</p>
<p>And then at home, these beauties</p>
<p><img src="/images/2015/11/dsc_0365-large.jpg" alt="DSC_0365 (Large)" width="676" height="449" /></p>
<p>turned into this kind of beauty.</p>

<p>Now that’s what I call the fruit of one’s labors!</p>
