<p>To all the lovely readers of our blog, we wish you a very Merry Christmas! May you be blessed today and in the year to come.</p>
<p>God rest ye merry, gentlemen,<br>
Let nothing you dismay<br>
Remember, Christ, our Saviour<br>
Was born on Christmas day<br>
To save us all from Satanâ€™s power<br>
When we were gone astray<br>
O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
Comfort and joy<br>
O tidings of comfort and joy.</p>
