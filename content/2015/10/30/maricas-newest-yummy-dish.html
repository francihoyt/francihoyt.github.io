<p>Marica recently got a cookbook out of the library and was looking through it one afternoon. She came to me and said, “I’m going to make Stromboli, and I don’t want you to help me.” Sure! I told her to go ahead and call me if she needed any help, but she didn’t need any help. Look at the awesome results! Both beautiful <em>and</em> tasty.</p>

<p>Marica’s recipe repertoire is growing and there are now a few dishes she can make without any help. I love that this is something she wants to do all of her own volition. She enjoys it, she’s good at it, and I get a night off! Win-win, in my book!</p>
