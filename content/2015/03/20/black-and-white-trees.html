<p>I love the way leaf-less trees look so stark in black and white.</p>
<p>These photos were taken in Prospect Park, Brooklyn a couple of years back.</p>

<p>And this one in Lancaster County.</p>

<p>March was heralded in by a snowstorm, and it looked like this in front of our house just a couple of weeks ago:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2015/03/dsc_0096.jpg"><img src="/images/2015/03/dsc_0096.jpg" alt="DSC_0096" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Now that it’s mid-March, we’ve had some lovely warmer days, the snow piles have mostly melted and there’s a hopeful feeling in the air, but the trees are still stark and leafless. Not for long, though!</p>
<p>EDIT: I wrote this post earlier this week. Today, on the first official day of spring (and my birthday, no less), we are experiencing another snowstorm. Can you believe that?! Enough with the snow, already! :-)</p>
