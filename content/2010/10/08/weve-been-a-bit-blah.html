Maybe the germ/virus came through the heaters if it is air being channelled from somewhere.  You know, that’s how some bugs have been spread in those most sterile of all places, hospitals…</p>"

content = "<p>I found that I get sick with the season changes in NY, too. I am not sure what it is, but I often feel like it is because the seasons don’t gradually change, but it feels more sudden and unexpected. It seems to throw my body for a whirl.  I am praying that you all get better! Love you all</p>"

<p>The weather has turned colder, there has been a lot of (cold) rain, I’ve unpacked the winter clothes, the heaters have had their first few runs and we’ve all gotten sick. Ben has only had a couple of days where he didn’t feel too great, and Marica’s only had a bit of a runny nose, but Esther’s gotten hit the hardest. She’s been sick for over a week now with a runny nose and on-and-off fever, but thankfully no cough. The poor kid is going to cut a tooth too any day now, so she really has had it a bit rough. And the bug is slowly working its way through me too. Swollen glands, sore throat, headache, blocked nose… it seems that it is impossible to go through a season change without getting sick. What’s the deal with that? All to say that we’re laying low for a while and not doing lots of exciting NYC stuff. :-)</p>
