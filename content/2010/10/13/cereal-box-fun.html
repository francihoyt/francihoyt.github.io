<p>Last week we were all a bit under the weather, but of course when kids are sick they are still full of ideas and energy. So one morning after finishing off a box of cereal, I remembered doing crafts with cereal boxes as a kid and looked online for something to do with the cereal box. We got an idea <a href="http://todayisfun.com/blog/readmore/294">here</a>, and so Glitter Girl was born.</p>

<p>You start with an empty cereal box.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc05221.jpg"><img title="You start with this" src="/images/2010/10/dsc05221.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Open it up.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc05222.jpg"><img title="Open it" src="/images/2010/10/dsc05222.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>And put it back together. At first I thought we’d make some sort of animal with ears, but that idea didn’t last very long. :-) Though the ‘ears’ gave us something to attach the hat to later!</p>

<p>Marica loved cutting out things like the arms, eyes, nose and mouth.</p>

<p>An eye in progress.</p>

<p>Glue for the hat.</p>

<p>The finished product! Being girls, we could of course not resist putting copious amounts of glitter on her!</p>

<p>(Yes, in our pyjamas because we were having a sick day, remember!)</p>
