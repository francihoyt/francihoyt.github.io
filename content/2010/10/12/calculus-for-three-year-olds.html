<p>The other day Franci and I were talking about subjects we studied in high school, and Marica asked what “calculus” was. Franci said it was a type of maths (Marica’s been learning her written numbers). Marica of course replied that “she could do that”, but Franci said she was probably a bit young for calculus.</p>
<p>That was enough of a challenge for me, so I decided to give Marica her first calculus lesson. If you keep it graphical and leave out the algebra, calculus is actually a fairly simple subject — areas under curves (read “colouring in”) and slopes (“going up and down hills”).</p>
<p>Below is a photo of our worksheet. Diagram 1 is me showing her how to do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral">integration</a>. In diagram 2 I’m explaining <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative">differentiation</a>. And in diagram 3 I asked her to draw a curve, and then calculate the area under the curve from point A to point B using graphical techniques (she did a pretty good job).</p>
