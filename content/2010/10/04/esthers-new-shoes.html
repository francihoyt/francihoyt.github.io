content = "<p>Interesting you’re getting into proper shoes now. I’m just trying to find some on TradeMe for Erika. Similar style to what Esther has. (Bobux). On the expensive side, but aparantly lasting forever because they are leather. Hoping to find some soon. That photo is worth making a large print of! I like the black and white. - Elrike</p>"

<p>Esther recently got her first pair of shoes. She’s been a barefoot baby for all the 10 months of her life (not counting socks, of course!) and is taking a little while getting used to them!</p>
