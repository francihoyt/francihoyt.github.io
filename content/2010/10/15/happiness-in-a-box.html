<p>Yesterday afternoon was pretty grey, but then the rainy gloom was seriously cheered up by a special package from Oupa and Ouma Voges. It was filled with special goodies for all of us. Just check this out!</p>
<p>A special outfit each for the kids, bonjela for Esther (phew), a special hand-knitted jersey for Marica, a couple of cute golliwogs and some edible goodies and pretty serviettes.</p>

<p>The cute golliwogs, who I think from now on will be referred to as Bi Golly.</p>

<p>Thank you, Oupa and Ouma!</p>
<p>And thanks to those of you who have also blessed us with cards and packages — we really, really appreciate them!</p>
