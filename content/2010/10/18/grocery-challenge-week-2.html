content = "<p>Yeah, I reckon we’ll do Chinese on Friday. We’ve also done pizza two nights in a row (home-made) — we’re all a bit under the weather (again!? still?) so it’s working out better than expected. I might just make this $100 challenge! Maybe.</p>"

<p>In some ways, week 2 was a lot easier than week 1. I only bought what I needed, but it seemed that I needed more than $25 worth of stuff a week. You’re probably all thinking “I knew she couldn’t do it!”. I’m still going to try. :-) The thing that’s the killer is the fresh stuff — fruit, vegetables and milk. And I’m not really willing to cut that out of our diet for the sake of an experiment! At the same time, I’m going to try to use some meals I have in the freezer already over the next 2 weeks to see if I can still reach this $100 goal.</p>
<p>I’m getting into the swing of this buying-only-what-I-need business. That’s not to say I’m not longingly looking at the pack of cookies on sale for <em>only 2 bucks!</em> (even though I have however many other packs at home), but I’m starting to reason with myself in a more sane way, I hope.</p>
<p>I’m also happy to report that when you buy less, you waste less. I’ve had no rotten food or produce that’s needed to go in the rubbish. Yay for that!</p>
<p>Here’s what I spent during the second week of the challenge:</p>
<p>fresh fruit and vegies — $17.40<br>
gallon of milk — $3.39<br>
raisins — $2.59<br>
frozen vegies — $2.19<br>
dozen eggs — $0.99<br>
apple sauce for Esther — $2.69<br>
fish — $2.15<br>
1/2 gallon milk — $1.99<br>
yoghurt — $2.00<br>
peanut butter — $1.99</p>
<p>Total: $36.39.</p>
<p>Oh dear. That leaves $29.71 for the next 2 weeks. I’m positive that it will mostly be spent on fruit, veg and milk!</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re eating for week 3 of the challenge:</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong></p>
