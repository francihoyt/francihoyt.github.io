<p>Last weekend we visited Ben’s uncle Sherwood and aunt Sharon in Pottstown, near Philadelphia. It was a very nice restful weekend, just visiting and getting to know them a bit better. Their daughter, Esther, is away at college, but Jonathan was there and the kids loved playing with him — he’s really good with children.</p>
<p>Driving there was pretty good. Ben did really well in the rain and all the traffic, and the roads weren’t too busy, thankfully. Check this out: 6 lanes each way!</p>

<p>We passed a big nuclear power station with 2 great big chimneys billowing smoke into the sky, which to us kiwis were quite the sight to behold!</p>

<p>Uncle Sherwood and aunt Sharon live in a really nice area with beautiful old homes. We enjoyed being in their house — the space, multiple bathrooms, the backyard and tree swing, aunt Sharon’s good food, and the good company of family.</p>

<p>Here are some other pretty houses nearby:</p>

<p>Marica enjoyed playing outside even though it was a bit cold. Ben and Jonathan had a good time riding the unicycle and Ben even rode it with Marica on his shoulders! No photo, sorry.</p>

<p>We visited a historic house in Pottstown called Pottsgrove Manor. It’s been restored very well and we took a tour through. The bits I caught in between Esther’s crying (she had a cold) were very interesting!</p>

<p>A lovely weekend all around — thanks, uncle Sherwood and aunt Sharon (and Jonathan)!</p>
