content = "<p>This looks GOOD! We’ll definitely try it sometime after our tummy’s have settled again, after this bug :-). I’m so glad you refreshed our memories about the fudge recipe too. I printed it out before I forget to, and it will go straight to the seafood section of the recipe book you gave me…because the sweet section got filled up a long time ago already. And I only add true and tried recipes! We’ll have some good sweet things for our coffees when you get back, sister! Love you all.</p>"

<p>I have another easy and yummy recipe to share with you. This is kind of like a quiche, and kind of like a pie… and it is so fast it almost feels like cheating! It’s a Jo Seagar recipe, one that I acquired at the same time as <a href="/2010/09/23/really-good%C2%A0fudge/">the fudge recipe</a>.</p>
<p>I reckon this could be a nice easy way of using up some Christmas left-overs!</p>
<p>You start by preheating the oven to 180C/350F.</p>
<p>Then mix together in a big bowl:</p>
<p>4 beaten eggs<br>
1 1/2 cups of sharp cheese<br>
1 small chopped onion<br>
6 rindless rashers of bacon, chopped (I reckon it tastes better if you cook them in a pan for a bit before you add them to the mix)<br>
1/2 cup self-raising flour<br>
1 1/2 cups milk<br>
1/4 c chopped parsley (or use some dried, maybe a tablespoon)<br>
salt and pepper to taste<br>
2 cups of whatever vegetables tickles your fancy. I like mushrooms and asparagus.</p>
<p>Pour the mixture in a greased oven dish and bake for 40 minutes or until nice and golden on top.</p>

<p>Enjoy! It tastes good hot or cold.</p>
