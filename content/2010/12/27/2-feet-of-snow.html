<p>We have had a great <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/APb4619e25f7ae44d18256e4755a5706ec.html">big snow storm</a> that started yesterday and continued through the night. We’re loving it big time! We have a snow drift that goes almost to the top of our fence in the back yard, and this morning when I went outside on the side walk I had snow up to my mid thighs. It’s beautiful, soft and fluffy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately both the kids are sick and not up to enjoying it, but Ben, Lillian and a couple of friends have gone sledding now. When they get back I’ll post some photos!</p>
