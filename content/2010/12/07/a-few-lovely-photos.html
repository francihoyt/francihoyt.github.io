<p>I thought I’d share a few photos of our time with the Braunings. We were so blessed by their hospitality, company, conversation and great food. Thanks again for inviting us, Mr &amp; Mrs Brauning, and putting up with our changed plans and an invalid!</p>

<p>Next to the Braunings’ house was this display. I hate to think where they store all this stuff all year!</p>
