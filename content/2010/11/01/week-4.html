<p>Let’s just say I’m glad to have life returning to normal! It was a good little exercise in sticking to a budget (or close to, anyway), but I don’t think I’ll be doing that again any time soon. To be honest, if I literally had only $25 a week to spend on groceries, I’d be visiting food pantries for help! As I’ve said before — I could only do it because I already had some food stocked up in my cupboards and a few things in my freezer. I didn’t have loads (I don’t have room for loads!) but certainly enough to help us get through this last month! Now the challenge will be to restock without breaking my usual budget!</p>
<p>But I guess you all want to know by just how much I went over. :-)</p>
<p>As you’ll remember, I had $10.50 left to spend on groceries for the last week of October to be able to meet my $100 challenge for the month. I didn’t make the challenge, I’m afraid to say, but I didn’t exactly go over by too much.</p>
<p>Here’s what I bought the last week:</p>
<p>fruit &amp; vegetables — $10.82<br>
gallon of milk — $3.39<br>
butter — $3.29<br>
cheese — $4.58</p>
<p>cream cheese — $0.99<br>
cream — $1.59<br>
bacon — 4.69</p>
<p>(The last 3 extravagant items were for things I made when we had guests over. :-))</p>
<p>Total for week 4: $29.35</p>
<p><strong>Total for October: $118.85</strong></p>
<p>Crazy stuff. Thanks for keeping me accountable. I’m glad it’s done!</p>
