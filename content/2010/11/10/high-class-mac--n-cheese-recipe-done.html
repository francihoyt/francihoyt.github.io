content = "<p>Also good—macaroni and chopped onion boiled together, drain water, add sliced sausage or hotdog, mix in [cheddar] cheese (saving a bit for the top) and bake for 1/2 an hour.  Had it for dinner last night and hope leftovers appear for lunch today.  (:  Basil does sound good, though.</p>"

<p>We recently had an Italian-themed pot-luck lunch at church (we have pot-lucks once a month on the Sunday we have Lord’s Supper) and I wanted to find a recipe that was not just another lasagne. In my online search I came across <a href="http://www.newitalianrecipes.com/macaroni.html">this recipe</a>, which I thought tasted very yummy indeed. So I’ll share it here. I remembered to take some photos while making it, but forgot to take a photo of the end product, sorry! I seem to detect a common theme here… You’ll just have to make it to see what it looks like finished. :-)</p>
<p>I call this High Class Mac ‘n Cheese.</p>
<p>You boil some macaroni noodles and add yummy things like basil leaves,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc05490.jpg"><img title="tearing up basil" src="/images/2010/10/dsc05490.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="512" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>sun-dried tomatoes,</p>
<p><a href="/images/2010/10/dsc05490.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc05493.jpg"><img title="Add some sundried tomaties" src="/images/2010/10/dsc05493.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>(sliced) hot Italian sausages,</p>
<p><a href="/images/2010/10/dsc05490.jpg"></a><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/10/dsc05495.jpg"><img title="Helping with sausages" src="/images/2010/10/dsc05495.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>and a bunch of other things. Make the white sauce, mix it all together and top with breadcrumbs (I added Parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs). Pretty easy and yum!</p>
<p>(Don’t you just envy all my bench space?!)</p>
