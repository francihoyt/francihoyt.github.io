I hope you and your Pappa are feeling MUCH better now.  Hopefully Esther doesn’t get that nasty bug.  You’re probably being a super good girl and helper for your Pappa aye - he’ll be missing your Mamma.  Hug for you and little Esther too.  Love from Marcelle.</p>"

<p>We got the tummy bug over the weekend — fun for the whole family! But Franci’s “bug” hung around, and then got more and more painful. Turns out she has acute appendicitis. They’re going to cut her open tonight (might as well not “mince” words) and remove her appendix.</p>
<p>But thank God for high-tech medicine and quick diagnoses! Prayer appreciated.</p>
