<p>Two weekends ago we visited friends from church for lunch who recently got married, Franco and Neli. Franco grew up in NYC and Neli is from Peru. They’re a really lovely couple!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05624.jpg"><img title="Franco &amp; Neli" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05624.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Franco and Neli live in a tall apartment building a block away from Central Park. Here’s their balcony view:</p>

<p>After a delicious lunch, we headed over to Central Park to enjoy some pretty fall colours.</p>
<p>I must apologise to those of you on dial-up, because this post is very photo-heavy!</p>
<p><img title="Red" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05663.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>The colours were just amazing, and it was interesting how often just one tree in a bunch of green ones would be in full colour.</p>

<p>I love this photo. I’ve been enjoying playing a bit with my camera more and then playing with photos on Picasa.</p>

<p>Central Park is so pretty. You can hardly believe you’re in the middle of a bustling city if it wasn’t for the background noise of traffic and the tall buildings towering over the trees!</p>

<p>Some of you might recognise this fountain from some movies.</p>

<p>No trip to a park is complete without Marica finding some sticks to play with!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05631.jpg"><img title="Stick Girl" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05631.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="288" /></a> <img title="Enjoying the leaves" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05675.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>In the fall and winter, the little food vendor stalls sell caramelised nuts. <img title="New York nuts" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05677.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>The smell alone is amazing, and holding a little bag of warm nuts in your hand and then eating them is quite the treat.</p>

<p><img title="Lighted path" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05716.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>By the time we left it was almost dark. I like the way this picture turned out with Franco and Neli and Ben with Marica on his shoulders.</p>
<p>And, just in case you’ve forgotten what we look like, here’s a reminder. :-)</p>
