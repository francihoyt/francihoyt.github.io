Erika loves putting things in holes at the moment, so I made a large-ish square hole in the top of a cereal box where she drop things in, and a flap-door on the bottom side to take things out again. She loves it, and everything that fits, goes in! Much love to you all!</p>"

<p>When we looked for ideas for what kinds of crafts one can make with cereal boxes, back when we made <a href="/2010/10/13/cereal-box-fun/">Glitter Girl</a>, we also came across a cute idea of making sandals. I promised Marica we’d do that, and here’s the result. <a href="http://familyfun.go.com/crafts/cereal-box-sandals-668644/">We found the idea here</a>, and modified it a bit to make it prettier.</p>
<p>Here’s how you do it:</p>
<p>First you have to eat up a whole box of cereal. Preferably not in one sitting.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05798.jpg"><img title="Eat a whole box of cereal first" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05798.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Then you open it up and trace a couple of shoe prints.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05799.jpg"><img title="Shoe print" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05799.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Then do the same on some colourful paper. Your possibilities are endless: princess shoes, brown shoes, fire truck shoes, striped shoes. We went with the latter look.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05800.jpg"><img title="Pretty paper" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05800.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Cut the shoe prints out.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05801.jpg"><img title="Cutting" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05801.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Cut out some straps, then glue the pretty paper to the cereal box cardboard.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05803.jpg"><img title="The ingredients" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05803.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Measure the length of the strap on your child’s foot, then stick it to the sole with some strong sticky tape.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05804.jpg"><img title="Measure strap length" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05804.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Ta-daa! You’re done!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05807.jpg"><img title="Done" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05807.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Pretty stinkin’ cute, and usable too!</p>
