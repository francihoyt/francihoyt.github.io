I could go on, but you’ve no doubt read more such examples than I have.  At least Franci’s “trick” (to use your term) was totally unintended!</p>"

<p>Just letting any readers know that the surgeon was able to remove Franci’s inflamed appendix successfully. Apparently it was pretty close to bursting when they operated. She’s sore and tired, but seems to be recovering well. We’re very thankful (to the Great Physician, especially) that it went smoothly and the doctors were able to act fast. Thanks for your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>We’d still love to be able to go to Philadelphia this weekend, but at this stage it’s still up in the air.</p>
<p>Note that Franci isn’t really blogging from hospital. The blog post “Taking a little break” that appeared this morning is one that Franci scheduled last week to self-publish today. The wonders of modern blogging software … tricking people into thinking you recover super-fast. :-)</p>
