Think Matthew 12:43-45—if we do not rely on God to cleanse us, we will be like this wicked generation that tries to clean itself out but ends up worse than before.</p>"

<p>My kitchen/dining room floor gets swept at least once a day. Usually more, but at least once. I never cease to be amazed at how much junk can land on the floor in just a day. This was last night’s loot:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05901.jpg"><img title="A day's filth" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05901.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>As I was sweeping the floor <em>again</em>, I got thinking. Maybe I was just tired, but hey, the illustration works. That floor and my heart has a lot in common. It gets dirty every single day. And not just a little dirty either. It needs daily sweeping out, otherwise the filth of discontent or bitterness or annoyance or irritability or a host of other junky things builds up in it. I’m sure you know how gross it is to walk barefoot on a dirty floor and get all sorts of bits stuck to the bottom of your foot. When I don’t clean out my heart regularly in prayer before God, then I become like a dirty floor for others to have to walk across. Totally unpleasant. People step over quickly and lightly because spending time around me is crunchy underfoot.</p>
<p>So I keep sweeping.</p>
