Actually, this reminds me of a really great set of children’s books that shows you how to make animals with different vegetables.  I think the ones I’ve seen are by Saxton Freymann:</p>\n<p>Fast Food<br>\nBaby Food<br>\nDog Food<br>\nHow Are You Peeling?: Foods with Moods</p>\n<p>I’d highly recommend them if you can find them in your library.  There might even be more along the same lines; I don’t know.</p>"
