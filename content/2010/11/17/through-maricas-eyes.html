<p>Marica absolutely loves being allowed to use the camera to take photos. And I always have a chuckle when I download them and see just what caught her eye. Let’s just say that she has a realistic view and she takes pictures of it — she won’t avoid the messy room. :-)</p>
<p>So here’s a little sampler of her photography. Occasionally she’ll even get a pretty good one, like the one of Esther.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05758.jpg"><img title="Esther" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05758.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05778.jpg"><img title="The kitchen" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05778.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p><img src="/images/2010/11/dsc05812.jpg" alt="" /> <img src="/images/2010/11/dsc05765.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05356.jpg"><img title="Notice board above computer" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05356.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> <a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/11/dsc05355.jpg"><img title="With guests" src="/images/2010/11/dsc05355.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>And a question to finish off with (for those of you who got this far!): What photo size do you prefer? Medium like above, or the large size I usually use?</p>
