content = "<p>Can you just see Bev, Hendrik and I (Elrike) bending over the laptop reading those lines from Marica and cracking up with pretty much every one of them! As usual, one could almost laugh just as much at Hendrik laughing as one laughs at the quotes. We might steal that idea for when Erika starts talking, if that’s ok. Mrs Voges explained some of them to us last night at church. However, she never got to explain the ‘smoking with Ouma’-one. Hmm…</p>"

content = "<p>I’m enjoying picturing Bevan, Elrike, and Hendrik laughing at the tweets (or just joining whatever’s making Hendrik and Carline laugh); I’ve had fun introducing people to Mr. Bean’s beekeeper interview, which always brings them to mind.  Guess that’s my favorite laughing with the Bakker’s episode.  :)  And, yes, the tweets are great.  It’s a perfect way to let us share in Marica’s thoughts and humor…but please translate the Afrikaans EVERY time!</p>"

content = "<p>Wow, if Marica can already distinguish between “lay down” and “lie down” at three…just think of all the grammar mistakes she’ll notice by the time she’s a big girl!</p>"

<p>I don’t understand the appeal of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. Just as you’re three quarters of the way through your controversial opening statement, you have t…</p>
<p>But anyway, Franci and I did find a good use for it. You know all those weird and wonderful things three-year-olds say but you always forget to write down? Tweet them for posterity!</p>
<p>So here’s Marica’s Twitter page, which we sometimes remember to add her sayings to:</p>
