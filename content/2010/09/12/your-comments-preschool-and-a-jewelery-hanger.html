content = "<p>Well, there’s still room in the little box, and I guess I should have added that some of my make-up lives in the bathroom! :-) As for the jewelery… I’m always open to more! (hint-hint to Ben, hehe) I didn’t bring all my jools from NZ either. But rest assured, I’m coping quite well! :-)</p>"

<p>Some people have told us that they enjoy our blog. Thanks, that’s cool! :-) However, I would encourage you to add your comments — having a blog is a bit like us having a conversation with everyone who reads it, and your comments help this conversation feel a little less one-sided. So feel free to comment!</p>
<p>Some of you asked how Marica’s doing at preschool. The first day she cried a fair bit when I left, but then mellowed and relaxed a bit. The second day there was no crying and she seemed a lot more comfortable. Now she keeps asking when she can go to preschool again (she’ll be going on Tuesdays and Thursdays): “Mummy, is it just one more sleep till preschool?”</p>
<p>A number of you told me that you enjoyed seeing how I made the <a href="/2010/07/22/from-old-to-new/">stools and artsy squares</a>, so I thought I’d share with you another little thing I made. For the last 3 months, my necklaces and pretty things have just lived in a great big knot in a ziplock bag, which is most definitely a dire dilemma. I was tempted to go buy one of those pretty necklace stands, but thought the better of it and decided to make something instead. A free photo frame and some nails later, and my bracelets and necklaces have a place to call home. (You pick up all sorts of free things on the side of the road here in NYC — if people don’t want something, they’ll leave it on the stairs to their house and you can help yourself. I love it!)</p>

<p>My <em>real</em> ‘jools’ (as Ben calls them) — the ones that are actually worth something — live in an egg carton (that’s my mum’s clever idea) in a little decorative little briefcase that I got at Goodwill for $2.99.</p>

<p>They live there with a small amount of make-up, hair clips and a pair of blue ear plugs. One day I’ll still line the egg carton with some felt, but for now I think they’re just thankful to be out of the ziplock.</p>
