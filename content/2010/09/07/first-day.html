content = "<p>I babysat for a two year old last week…just turned two, just started preschool, and had only seen me once before.  About 20 min. of pointing vaguely off in the distance (we were about a minute’s walk from his home downtown) crying “Mummy” every second or two and pitiful little tears running down his face.  He wasn’t difficult, just very sad.  1/2 way through lunch at a restaurant he’s familiar with, he got going again.  I felt sorry for him but also like a kidnapper.  Naptime helped considerably.</p>"

<p><a href="/images/2010/09/dsc04657.jpg"></a>Today is a pretty big day here in the Hoyt household. It’s Marica’s first day at an American preschool!</p>

<p>She was really excited and keen, all smiles walking there and meeting the teachers and putting her bag away and finding her name on the table.</p>

<p>But when she realised that I wasn’t staying, she wasn’t so sure about this preschool thing any more. In fact, she was very sure she <em>didn’t</em> want to stay there. She cried and very articulately identified the fear — “I don’t know anyone!” and held onto me very tightly. At that point I almost felt like throwing in the towel and taking her home, but I managed to extricate myself. It was hard for me, because I totally identify with that fear. But I think it will be a good opportunity for both of us to make some new friends.
