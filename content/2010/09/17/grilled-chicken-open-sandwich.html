content = "<p>Thanks Franci! Wish I read this last night when we wanted something light. but not take- aways. B.t.w. I tried that Aussie Chicken two nights after you posted the recipe. I, too, made it for the first time on a guest. But since you said it cannot fail, I didn’t worry about the outcome. And we loved it! It’s safely in that handy recipe book which you made for me.<br>\nI had to turn a second index tab to ‘sweets’! Hmm…let’s say it reflects my husband’s wishes :-)<br>\nKeep sharing great recipes please. You’re so capable in the kitchen!<br>\nLove, Elrike</p>"

<p>The other night I didn’t feel much like cooking, but didn’t want to spend money on take-aways either. I also had some chicken in the fridge that had thawed that needed to be used. What I thought would end up as a slap-together quick dinner, ended up being really yummy, so I decided to share it with you.</p>
<p>Heat oven on ‘high’ grill/broil. Cut chicken breasts into 2cm thick slices and fry in a little butter. Sprinkle on garlic salt while cooking.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, spread however many slices of good bread you think you’ll need with butter.</p>
<p>In another pan sauté some an onion sliced in rings. When they are soft, sprinkle a large pinch of sugar over the onions to caramelise them while cooking a little longer.</p>
<p>Top the bread with the cooked chicken and onions and put some sliced cheese on top. Whatever cheese you have on hand will do fine, but preferably not a sharp cheese — something mellow like swiss or colby or edam will work well.</p>
<p>Place under the grill/broiler until the cheese is melted. Sprinkle some chopped parsley over top and serve with a salad. Yum!</p>
