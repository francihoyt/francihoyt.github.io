<p>While Christchurch is still having earthquakes, here in Brooklyn we had our very own tornado (or super-severe storm — the weather service isn’t sure which). The winds and rain whipped up all of a sudden, picked up huge branches and even trees and threw them across the streets, and then twenty minutes later it was dead calm again.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I left work just after the tornado stopped. At the time, I had no idea it was more than a heavy wind — in Manhattan where I work we just had some strong winds and hard rain. Then I got out of the subway station in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, and wondered if some city contractors had been through to trim all the trees, and done a really bad job cleaning up. That’s what it looked like at first — there were leaves, branches, and whole trees (we’re talking half a metre in diameter!) strewn across the footpath and street. But on closer inspection, they hadn’t been cut by chain saws. The divine hand doesn’t cut neatly.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the kind of thing many people came home to in Park Slope (just a few blocks away from us):</p>

And there’s some <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local-beat/Tornado-Warning-Issued-for-Eastern-New-York-City-103086814.html">video footage and a news article with more information here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Anyway, we’re all safe and sound, don’t worry. And thankfully the car we’re borrowing was away from trees and untouched.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Franci recorded a weird (and funny!) video of what was happening to our toilet during the tornado. You can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bfhoyt/5003209984/">watch that on our Flickr page here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And here are a few more photos that I took outside our apartment:</p>
