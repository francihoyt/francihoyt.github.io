<p>My cousin Hannah Holder has a lovely website detailing some of the fine art she has done (and can do). She now has her very own domain name, so browse on over to <a href="http://www.hannahholder.com/">HannahHolder.com</a> and see it for yourself.</p>
<p>From lovely black and white drawings:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/09/st-johns-cathedral.jpg"><img title="St John's Cathedral" src="/images/2010/09/st-johns-cathedral.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="475" /></a></p>
<p>To colourful pieces like this one (the original of which is mounted in our NYC apartment lounge):</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/09/butterflies-and-flowers.jpg"><img title="Butterflies and Flowers" src="/images/2010/09/butterflies-and-flowers.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>To amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher">Escher</a>-esque paintings like this one she made for my unicycling brother and his wife:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/09/five-blew-away-in-the-parade.jpg"><img title="Five Blew Away in the Parade" src="/images/2010/09/five-blew-away-in-the-parade.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="432" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Oh, she does some <a href="http://www.hannahholder.com/calligraphy/paper/">really good calligraphy</a>, too.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure you can purchase her artwork (copies, and originals in some cases). And she may well be available to do the odd piece of commissioned artwork — I’m sure you can <a href="http://www.hannahholder.com/contact/">contact her here</a> if you’re interested in something beautiful!</p>
