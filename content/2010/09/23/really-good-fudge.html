content = "<p>I, being impatient at times, have a super fast, super easy, super delicious recipe for peanut butter fudge. You take one regular sized jar of peanut butter and heat it up, either on the stove or in the microwave. In a bowl, you add one package of store-bought cream cheese frosting. After thoroughly mixing, you spread on wax paper or aluminum foil and put in the freezer for it to set. It is soooooooooooo good!!! Also, another quick and yummy recipe is for homemade(ish) sherbert. Pick one packet of any flavor Kool-Aid(cheap brand is super) and mix it with 1 cup of sugar and 3 cups of milk. After it is mixed, put in the freezer for an hour or two. At that time, the sherbert is slightly mushy. Take it out of the freezer and mix it up very well. (Use an electirc mixer for smoother results than a fork produces). Pour mixture from the bowl into shallow, freezer-safe container, and cover. After it sets, you have delicious sherbert that “I made myself”. Kids love it! (Who am I kidding? I love it, too.)</p>"

<p>I haven’t made fudge many times before, but whenever I’ve tried, it’s turned out terribly. Either too soft and runny, or hard and crystallised. Until the day I made this recipe that I obtained in a dubious way…</p>
<p>I was sitting in the doctor’s waiting room in Christchurch a good number of months back. For some reason I was in a side room on my own and I spent the time browsing a Next magazine or some magazine like that when I came across a bunch of recipes of Jo Seagar’s that they had published. And they all looked SO good. The magazine was old and getting on a bit in looks… I’m sure they were going to throw it out soon… so I ripped out the recipes and popped them in my bag. Now, in hindsight, I should have asked whether that would be ok. But I didn’t…</p>
<p>The other night I explained how I got the recipe over dinner to Ben, in full hearing of Marica, who then proceeded to berate me and enlighten me about how “stealing is really bad, Mummy”. I stand convicted. It’s still a really good recipe, and I’m going to share it with you, so you can be partakers of my crime. :-)</p>
<p>If you want to make fudge that isn’t at all grainy, that is smooth and super yummy, that takes about 20 minutes from start to finish, then this one’s for you.</p>

<p><strong>Jo’s Fabulous Fudge</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">(I halve this recipe.)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">2 x 400g cans sweetened condensed milk</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">2 cups firmly packed soft brown sugar</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">250g butter</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">100ml liquid glucose syrup (I used corn syrup and it worked fine)</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">3 tablespoons golden syrup (I’m sure you could just add extra glucose syrup if you don’t have golden syrup)</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">1 teaspoon vanilla</span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;">400g white chocolate, chopped (or use chips)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">1. Use a tin that’s 20 x 30cm and at least 4cm deep: spray it with non-stick baking spray and line with non-stick baking paper. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">2. Place all ingredients, except the chocolate and vanilla in a large heavy-based saucepan and stir over medium heat until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">3. Bring to the boil and boil gently until it becomes very thick and changes colour to a dark caramel/brown-paper shade - about 6 to 8 minutes, or until it reaches the soft-ball stage).</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">4. Stir continuously with a silicon spatula.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">5. Remove from heat and stand until the bubbles subside. Stir in the vanilla and chocolate and beat until melted and smooth.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">6. Pour in the prepared tin and smooth the surface. Cool to room temperature (about 3 hours) and then refrigerate until firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">7. Cut into squares. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 6 weeks, or can be frozen.</span></p>
