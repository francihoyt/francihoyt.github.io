<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/04/benfrancimaricaesther-cropped.jpg"><img title="The Hoyts -- click to blow us up" src="/images/2010/04/benfrancimaricaesther-cropped.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="278" height="299" /></a>So we’re going overseas in a month and, just to be different like everyone else, we’re starting a blog.</p>
<p>We’re hoping to post updates about how it’s all going, and about life in the <a title="New York City" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Apple">Big Apple</a>. Franci and Marica and Esther will officially be aliens (I might as well be too, having lived in New Zealand for all but the first four months of my life).</p>
<p>I’m writing this first post, but Franci will probably be chief journalist around here. You can still get to our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bfhoyt/">Flickr photos here</a> and to my website at <a href="http://benhoyt.com/">benhoyt.com</a>.</p>
