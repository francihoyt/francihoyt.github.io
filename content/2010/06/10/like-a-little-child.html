<p>Last night as I was putting Esther to bed, Marica peeked into the door and said out of the blue and quite matter of factly with her little double-jointed forefinger pointing upwards that “Wanneer ek doodgaan, ek gaan hemel toe by Jesus.” (“When I die, I’m going to heaven with Jesus.”) And then she promptly went and played again. Now that’s assurance of salvation!</p>
<p><em>And he said: “I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” Matt 18:3</em></p>
