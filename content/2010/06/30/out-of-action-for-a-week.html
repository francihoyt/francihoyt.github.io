<p>Tomorrow, Lord willing, we move into our apartment. While this is great, it does however mean that we will be without internet access for a week. Actually, <em>I’ll</em> be without internet access for a week because Ben will still be able to check email and stuff at work. Our internet is booked to be connected next Wednesday, so hopefully they carry through!</p>
<p>Until then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish">so long and thanks for all the fish</a>.</p>
