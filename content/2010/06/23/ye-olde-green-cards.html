content = "<p>That is amazing that they have come through already. Ours took 4 years from when we applied. So our temporary visas had to be extended out to the maximum, then we traveled on a status of “accepted but not issued”, ie our application was accepted just not processed. I traveled in and out of the US for 2 years with that hanging over me - having to go to secondary processing each time I re-entered the USA. All this to say that this is another way in which you can count your blessings :-)</p>"

content = "<p>Yes, we’re very thankful! Ron, it is probably a bit different because I’m a citizen, though. Franci and the kids actually had to have temporary permanent resident status <i>before</i> we even left for the U.S. There was no other general visa they could come in on — because I’m a citizen, “they” didn’t trust us not to stay, and then Franci would have been an overstayer. Something like that. We’re here now, anyway! :-)</p>"

<p>I am happy to report that Marica, Esther and I are now the proud owners of U.S. green cards. (Not just the temporary paperwork, but the Real Thing.) The cards arrived in the mail yesterday, so we are now officially Permanent Residents of the United States of America.</p>
<p>And as wonderful as it is, I hope that permanent doesn’t mean forever. Two years seem like a good amount of permanent to me. :-)</p>
