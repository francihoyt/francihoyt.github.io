<p>I know that a number of you read our blog, and thanks for that! It’s nice to know that people are interested in staying in contact with us.</p>
<p>Though, as you’ve probably noticed by now, we certainly don’t post everyday (our lives aren’t <em>that</em> interesting!). To save you coming to the blog site and finding that we <em>still</em> haven’t posted, you can subscribe instead by clicking on the Subscribe Me! button to the right. When you do that, the blog posts we write are delivered to you by email. It looks pretty much the same as coming to the actual blog and that way you don’t have to keep remembering to come to the blog either. :-)</p>
<p>So go ahead and click Subscribe Me!</p>
