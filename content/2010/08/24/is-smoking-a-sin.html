<p>I just read <a href="http://dougwils.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7930:why-cigarette-smoking-is-not-a-sin-for-others-just-a-sin-for-you&amp;catid=85:dealing-with-sin">this short address</a> by Doug Wilson to a bunch of Christian college students and found it a refreshing argument against smoking rather than the usual ‘it ruins your body’.</p>
