content = "<p>I liked the movie Julie and Julia too.  One thing I especially liked about it was that both the featured married couples had GOOD marriages.  They were real and the couples  really liked and loved each other and had a good sense of play.  I guess you just don’t see that many movies with happy healthy marriages being portrayed so well and so realistically.   It’s kind of refreshing.<br>\n(It’s my first time to your blog.  I clicked on your name from a comment you left on Femina)<br>\nAnyway - enjoy your cookbook!</p>"

content = "<p>Loren and I also saw Julie &amp; Julia, this past summer. It was one of my favorites. But whatever you do, don’t read the author’s follow-up book.</p>\n<p>I always thought that French cooking called for a lot of expensive/obscure ingredients, so let me know how that goes.</p>\n<p>It was so lovely to meet you at the reunion, Franci :-)</p>"

<p><a class="img-link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279490719&amp;sr=8-1"><img title="Mastering the Art of French Cooking" src="/images/2010/07/french-cooking.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="205" height="293" /></a>My lovely husband has recently bought me Julia Child’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Art-French-Cooking-Vol/dp/0375413405/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279490719&amp;sr=8-1">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>. </em>I have read the preface and all the introductory remarks. Now I need to start cooking from it. It’s just been so hot that cooking anything that isn’t a hamburger patty is not very appealing, even if it <em>is</em> French.</p>
<p>Ben is not a fan of French food (he’s had it once, and it was a bad <em>and</em> expensive experience that involved sandy snails), so why would he buy me a book on French cooking? Firstly because he’s great, but secondly because I was keen on owning it. But could I be keen on owning it if I didn’t even know who Julia Child was a month ago?</p>
<p>Well, it’s all the fault of <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, you see. Because here in the States you can get movies on demand over the internet, and someone recommended that we watch <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/julieandjulia/">Julie &amp; Julia</a>. It is a movie about Julia Child’s life in France, and a year in the life of Julie Powell, a New Yorker who blogged about cooking through <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking. </em>I loved the movie, I loved the great way Meryl Streep acts in it, I loved the food, I loved the humour and I loved that I recognised so much of the New York parts in it!</p>
<p>(I heartily recommend that you watch this movie. It got a 75% rating on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/julie_and_julia/">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. It does however have a minor amount of profanity, as far as movies go, but I did not think that it detracted from the story. You will laugh often and your mouth will water pretty much just as often. Oh, and you’ll see married couples kissing. :-)</p>
<p>And then when <em>Ben offered out of the blue</em> to buy me this cookbook, I jumped at the chance! And you know what makes it even more special? He used an amazon gift card he got as a present to buy something for me. I’m blessed.</p>
<p>When I start cooking from it, I will let you know how it turns out. :-)</p>
