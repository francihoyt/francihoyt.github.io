<p style="text-align:left;">When Ben came home 2 weeks ago and told me that we were leaving for NYC in 4 1/2 weeks instead of the original 12 weeks, I went into a mini panic, so to speak. We made a list of all the things he needed to do and what I needed to do. His list was quite long and included things like “cancel utilities”. My list was quite short - it said “pack”.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I have to pack up all our belongings to go into storage for 2 years, except for the things that we can fit into our suitcases, which even though we have 8 pieces of luggage, isn’t very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So we’ve seen a lot of this kind of thing recently:</p>
<a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03386.jpg"><img title="Boxes" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03386.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Even Marica has been quite useful (sort of):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03411.jpg"><img title="Marica with bubble wrap" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03411.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a>She’s been really good at keeping herself entertained too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03414.jpg"><img title="Marica's handiwork" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03414.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">And while there is certain satisfaction in seeing good progress in packing, it seems that there is something inherently wrong and desolate about an empty bookcase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a class="img-link" href="/images/2010/05/dsc03415.jpg"><img title="Empty bookcases" src="/images/2010/05/dsc03415.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="640" height="853" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It reminds me of when my parents moved to New Zealand from Namibia and were selling truckloads of stuff and a guy came to my parents and asked if he could buy their bookcases “with the books”. It was intended to go into his office (I think he was a local pastor) and he didn’t care what the books were, he just knew that lots of books on the bookshelf makes you look intelligent and important. :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I’m really looking forward to buying books in the States - it’s so much cheaper there. And then we might have to expand our bookcase collection from 4 to 5!</p>
