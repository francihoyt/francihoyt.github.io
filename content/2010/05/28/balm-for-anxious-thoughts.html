content = "<p>Hi, this is the first time I’ve read your blog, thanks for letting us know how things are going. We have been praying for you guys over the past months and were hoping everything was going well for you. I can only but imagine how different (a slight understatement, I know) things will be. I take my hat off to you. What you wrote was even a comfort to me and I’m not in half the situation you’re in, so thank you and may the Lord continue to protect and guide you all. Love, Sunny and the Martin boys. x</p>"

content = "<p>I’ve been wishing I could be there to welcome you and help you transition to a new country as you helped me so much in the first two weeks, especially.  Not that I know much about NY, but I would have loved to have welcomed you at the airport, given you a map, made tea and invited folks over (very much appreciated, even if slightly overwhelming at the end of a long trip).  BTW, I hear there’s a cloister at the end of one of the bus lines.  Open to the public, tourable, probably quiet…I’ll try to find out more information and send a link.  Oh, and one of the first good jugglers I ever saw was in Central Park.  Enjoy the pony ride, Marica!</p>"

<p>This morning, as I sit here alone with an apartment full of beautiful sleeping people, my mind is full of anxious thoughts. Things like, where will we end up living? Will I even like it here? How will my kids cope? How can I make these 2 years a joyful time? As I was thinking, it was as if the Holy Spirit gave me a good nudge to do something about these thoughts.</p>
<p>So I turned to Psalm 139: “If I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right had will hold me fast.” Now how’s that for comfort! The God who created me and knows me inside out, the One who hems me in - behind and before, He is the one who will guide us and hold us fast. He is in control - “All of the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”</p>
<p>We are in good hands.</p>
