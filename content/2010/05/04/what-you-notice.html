<p>It’s amazing what you notice about a place you’ve lived in for ages when you’re planning a trip overseas. For one thing, Christchurch has a lot of center-city apartments — never noticed ‘em before, but now they’re everywhere.</p>
<p>And the other night we went out for dinner to <a href="http://www.subway.co.nz/">Subway</a>. It’s obvious now, of course, but we’d never connected the name of the restaurant to actual subways. And just as we were sitting down we noticed the decor on the walls … images of a old subway map, New York City’s no less:</p>
