But was she doing her grating willingly and dexterously under her own steam and initiative, or did a lot of instructions and regulations and health precautions pare down her enthusiasm and make her look for a Kiwi to finish the job?  And were they Marican grown carrots and a Marican made grater?</p>"

<p>As the cruel parents we are, tonight we decided to make Marica grate – again:</p>

<p>Sorry, couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>But after I thought of the pun, I think there’s a serious point here, along the lines of that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._J._O%27Rourke">P. J. O’Rourke</a> quip: “Everybody wants to save the earth; nobody wants to help Mom do the dishes.”</p>
<p>Talking politics is all the rage today: pro-Trump, anti-Trump, this that and the other Facebook post. But life goes on, kids need putting to bed, and dishes need doing. Doing the small things right … that’s how to save the world.</p>
