<p>A statue of The Signer in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/01/dsc_0530-large.jpg"><img title="The Signer" src="/images/2012/01/dsc_0530-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>This photo is significant, because today a man from Philadelphia is signing a very special contract with a very special lady in Christchurch. Yes, today Jeremy and Lillian are getting married! Congratulations, guys!</p>
