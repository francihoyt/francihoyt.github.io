<p>Today Ben and I celebrate 7 wonderful years of marriage. I can truly say that it gets better, deeper, and more beautiful to be married to Ben every single year. God has been so faithful and good to us by blessing our marriage, and we are thankful to Him for His enduring love.</p>

<p>Though… we are not celebrating our anniversary <em>today</em>. Today is the day that disappears off my calendar because of the wonder of air travel. I am somewhere up in the air between NYC and Christchurch, departing on the 14th, arriving on the 16th, but travelling only (!) 25 hours. It’s weird. But we’ll celebrate when I get back! I’m taking the girls to attend Jeremy and Lillian’s wedding and to visit with family for a bit. Ben unfortunately needs to stay because he doesn’t have enough leave days and because he’s stepping up into a new role at work that keeps him very busy.</p>
<p>While I’m away, I’m taking a break from regular blogging. Instead, I’m going to have a series of some of my favourite black and white pictures from the past year self-publish every day from tomorrow until the end of January. (You might recognise a number of the photos if you’re a regular here.) I will resume regular blogging again sometime in February.</p>
