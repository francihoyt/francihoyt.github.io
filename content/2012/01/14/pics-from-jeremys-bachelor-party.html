<p>Last Saturday afternoon and evening, a few of Jeremy’s Philadelphia friends organized a bachelor party for him. They captured him, got in a little bit of trouble with the Philly police, and drove him blind-folded all the way to New York, where I joined them for dinner.</p>
<p>He had to eat blind-folded at a Burger King, wear a paper crown and carry a pink stuffed-toy pig around everywhere, preach an ad libbed three-minute sermon on biblical marriage near the World Trade Center, and some other fun stuff. Below are a few photos I took along the way.</p>
<p>Davis and Eshelman just after I met up with them:</p>
