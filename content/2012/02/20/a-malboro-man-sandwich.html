<p>I’m subsribed to <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/">The Pioneer Woman Cooks</a> blog, and with every recipe that comes from there I’m almost drooling. I’ve never had one of her recipes fail, and they’re always a hit. The <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/2007/06/marlboro_mans_f/">Malboro Man Sandwich</a> was especially a hit with Ben, and I loved it too.</p>
<p>I add arugula, fresh mozzarella and fat slices of fresh tomato. It’s SO good. It’s <strong>not</strong> a diet food.</p>

<p>A beautifully messy and totally delightful experience. You should make one for the man in your life, or any man in your life, or just for yourself!</p>

<p>Sorry about the out of focus pictures. And the dead flowers.</p>
