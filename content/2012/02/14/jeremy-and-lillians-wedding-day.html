content = "<p>Thanks, Mum! I actually had to do a fair bit of light editing of the photos afterwards — Bishopdale’s lighting is so harsh and horrible with those fluorescent lights. I tried to make it look as realistic as possible, but I’m still not 100% satisfied with a number of the shots, though my photo editing programme isn’t super powerful.</p>"

<p>On January the 21st <a href="/2011/09/01/the-last-one-bites-the-dust/">Jeremy and Lillian</a> tied the knot, and it was a beautiful day in all respects. It was lovely and sunny (even it if was a bit windy), everything went smoothly and it was just such a joyous day.</p>
<p>Here is the Groom and his Men looking very suave beforehand waiting for the bride. (I have to mention that this bride was <em>on time</em>! Thanks, Lillian! I always think it’s such bad form when brides are late.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/02/dsc_5849-large.jpg"><img title="The Groom and his men" src="/images/2012/02/dsc_5849-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I just had to include the Pursed Lip Club picture. Jeremy Davis obviously didn’t get the memo.</p>

<p>Here they come!</p>
<p>First the lovely Carline:</p>

<p>Then beautiful Rachael:</p>

<p>And then the stunning bride with her dad.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/02/dsc_5881-large.jpg"><img title="Dad and Lill" src="/images/2012/02/dsc_5881-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Just look at Jeremy’s face watching Lillian come down the aisle. I don’t think his smile could get any wider, to be honest.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/02/dsc_5879-large.jpg"><img title="Do you think he looks happy?!" src="/images/2012/02/dsc_5879-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>

<p>Jeremy Watson (this wedding was just overflowing with Jeremys!) did a great job on the organ, especially with the Widor Toccata as a recessional.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/02/dsc_5842-large.jpg"><img title="The organist" src="/images/2012/02/dsc_5842-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I felt so blessed to be sharing their special day with them and to have a special involvement with helping with doing the flowers (my mum did the ones for church and all the bouquets, I did the ones for the tables at the reception).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/02/dsc_5840-large.jpg"><img title="The front of church" src="/images/2012/02/dsc_5840-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>I think I’ll stop here, and do the rest of the photos in a few days’ time, otherwise we’re going to have a post with about 50 photos in it and those of you on dial-up will never talk to me again.</p>
