<p>Some of you might recall that it was at the Tschetter reunion (Ben’s mum’s side of the family) that my laptop hard drive died, so I lost photos of the first half of that stop as well, which is a real shame because Ben’s mum’s Uncle Herb and Aunt Susan came to visit one evening and I got some really nice shots of them, but hey, so’s life.</p>
<p>We stayed at the Rocky Mountain Mennonite Camp (which, incidentally, is not just for Mennonites) in an 11-room chalet. We had plenty of space, a very well equipped kitchen, a stunning view, and some great walks nearby to boot. With it being Mennonite-run, Grandpa found many connections and interesting people to talk to about knowing (about) some of the same families and places.</p>

<p>I do have a few photos I took of our 4th of July celebrations and some of the beautiful scenery around our chalet, so I can share those!</p>

<p>This was to be our last 4th of July in the States for who knows how long, so I volunteered to make dinner that night. Somehow it’s easier to feel patriotic in the States — there is vitually no patriotism in NZ!</p>

<p>I made some traditional food, or what the internets told me was supposed to be traditional 4th of July food: hamburgers, chips (not fries), potato salad, that kind of thing. I also made  a rather patriotic-looking cake (cake decorators, close your eyes!).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/08/dsc_1551-large.jpg"><img title="All of us around the table" src="/images/2012/08/dsc_1551-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p>All around the grounds were little ground squirrels (if someone can explain to me what the difference is between a ground squirrel and a chipmunk, I shall be much obliged) and they move so fast and unpredictably that I was glad to finally get a shot of one. The cheeky little things even made their way into our chalet one time by chewing a hole in the window screen and then having a little dig through some of the food in the kitchen!</p>

<p>There was a little pond on the grounds too with some kayaks available for use, and Marica was quite chuffed with the fact that she could go in one all by herself.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/08/dsc_1616-large.jpg"><img title="The pond" src="/images/2012/08/dsc_1616-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p>At our previous Tschetter reunion in 2010, I took many more photos of wildflowers. For some reason this is the only one I have of this past reunion.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/08/dsc_1657-large.jpg"><img title="Lovely Rocky Mountain wildflowers" src="/images/2012/08/dsc_1657-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="511" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, we worked in quite a number of Dutch Blitz games as well as some scrabble games with Grandpa.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/08/dsc_1631-large.jpg"><img title="Scrabble with Grandpa" src="/images/2012/08/dsc_1631-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>We finished two puzzles too, which I always enjoy doing — I never do it at home (as in adult puzzles, the ones I do with the kids at home don’t really count!), so puzzle building on holiday is always a treat for me.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/08/dsc_1633-large.jpg"><img title="Puzzling" src="/images/2012/08/dsc_1633-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>One morning Ben had to get up at 5am to go hike Pike’s Peak with Hannah, Eva and Aunt Marti, and then I couldn’t get back to sleep, so I went outside to the little hill out the back of our chalet where there was an outdoor worship area. I was hoping to catch some sunrise photos, but the sun didn’t quite rise where I hoped it would. I still got some nice shots, though and had fun trying some different things. It was also a rather marvelous place (and time!) for being alone and for prayer.</p>
