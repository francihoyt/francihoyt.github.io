content = "<p>HI Franci,<br>\nVery beautiful!  Also, very true to our American experience in Chicago.  And to Julie M, may it be some consolation that the hole left in your congregation is the means by which the hole in ours is once again filled.  From Ben and Franci’s pastor back here in NZ - God be with you!</p>"

<p>New York…</p>
<p>Your name invoked images, awe, presumptions<br>
of ghetto, gangster, glamour, glitz.<br>
Yet many will be surprised to know<br>
I found in you much goodness and grace<br>
just as ingrained<br>
as the grit and grime.</p>
<p>I arrived in your muggy embrace on a stifling night in May,<br>
and as I gradually acquainted myself with your form,<br>
you grieved me.<br>
Now, two years later,<br>
I am grieved once more.<br>
But the grief is different this time, my unexpected love.</p>
<p>“New York grows on you like a fungus”<br>
says Anna.<br>
I do believe she’s right.<br>
Can a fungus grow in the heart?<br>
Your roots burrow deep in mine.</p>
<p>You have taught me much about life —<br>
I walk past faces hard as flint<br>
inside them live eyes that have long forgotten how forgiveness feels<br>
I walk over petrified gum ground into the pavement<br>
I walk around the smelly legless homeless man<br>
(do I ignore him this time, or do I smile?)<br>
It’s physical <em>and</em> spiritual, this grit and grime,<br>
But it makes grace more glorious.</p>
<p>Beauty lives in you too, City of Contrasts,<br>
Your skyline’s famous fingerprint<br>
Your proud bridges<br>
Your art — you collect and inspire —<br>
Your playground sprinklers tickling children<br>
Your sprawling parks<br>
Your wide harbor with the proud green Lady<br>
Your beaches<br>
Your Christmas lights<br>
Your <em>people.</em></p>
<p>African, American, Asian,<br>
Hasid, Hipster, Hispanic (too many more to count)<br>
Is there a place, religion or philosophy not represented here?<br>
We all live side by side<br>
on top of each other.<br>
I’m pleasantly surprised by the peace<br>
as I sit in the evening cool<br>
on my Brooklyn stoop steps.</p>
<p>I am Lot’s wife,<br>
One last look at this Sodom<br>
that has been my home.<br>
But you are not completely Sodom<br>
because in you I have found many<br>
who are righteous<br>
who call on Him who washes us clean<br>
like the summer rains your streets.</p>
<p>I know some of them<br>
and I love them fiercely.<br>
They are your roots burrowing in my heart.<br>
They are what made you my home.</p>
