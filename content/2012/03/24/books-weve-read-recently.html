We’re partway through the Narnia books now with the girls, but that’s only the first time through!<br>\nSo I’m curious - do the books with BF by them mean that you’ve read them aloud together?<br>\nFranci, have I recommended “The Mission of Motherhood” by Sally Clarkson to you yet? Rather different from Loving the Little Years, but one I also really appreciated (and need to re-read).</p>"

I should ask Robert to put together a list of what he’s been reading sometime as he reads a lot more than me, quite widely too.</p>\n<p>Am enjoying “Little Britches” by Ralph Moody (at Liana’s recommendation) right now - I read it quickly first, and now am reading it to the family.</p>"

<p>For your interest, here’s a list of some of the books we’ve read in the last year or so, with a tiny summary of each. Most of them are really good. I’ve put B after the author’s name if only I’ve read it, F if just Franci’s read it, or BF if we’ve both read it. Feel free to ask further about specific books if you’d like!</p>
<p>So here goes, in more or less our reading order:</p>
<p><em>The Reason for God</em> by Tim Keller (B). Great book by the well-known New York City pastor answering doubts about and defending the Christian faith from a thinking point of view.</p>
<p><em>Total Truth</em> by Nancy Pearcey (B). A lengthy but very readable look at how Christianity is not just a private matter, but should affect the public sphere as well. Some overlap with Keller’s book.</p>
<p><em>The Hobbit</em>, by J. R. R. Tolkien (B). I read this to Marica almost a year ago now.</p>
<p><em>The Good of Affluence: Seeking God in a Culture of Wealth</em> by John Schneider (B). A thought-provoking discussion about how wealth can be compatible with Christianity. Schneider critiques left-leaning folks such as Ronald Sider.</p>
<p><em>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</em> by Betty Smith (BF). Really engaging novel written from the perspective of a girl from a very poor family in Brooklyn, set around 1912.</p>
<p><em>The Dragon’s Tooth</em> by N. D. Wilson (BF). Doug Wilson’s son has a serious imagination. A strange and full-on but compelling story, definitely American rather than British. Complete with its own <a href="http://vimeo.com/27156974">book trailer video</a>.</p>
<p><em>One Thousand Gifts</em> by Ann Voskamp (F). A book that transformed Franci’s outlook on life to becoming more thankful to God for everything — from the simple to the profound.</p>
<p><em>My Name is Asher Lev</em> and <em>The Chosen</em> (BF) and <em>The Gift of Asher Lev</em> and <em><em>The Promise</em></em>, all by Chaim Potok (F). Very readable and interesting novels, all about orthodox Jewish boys and their interaction with the “outside world”.</p>
<p><em>When People are Big and God is Small</em> by Ed Welch (F). An interesting look at keeping things in perspective, and overcoming the fear of man.</p>
<p><em>Loving the Little Years</em> by Rachel Jankovic (BF). A very encouraging look at how to pursue motherhood joyfully. One of Franci’s favourite books about mothering kids.</p>
<p><em>A Book of Bees: And How to Keep Them</em> by Sue Hubbell (F). A creative look at bee farming — Franci said it’s a great read whether or not you’ll ever keep bees.</p>
<p><em>C. S. Lewis: A Biography</em> by A. N. Wilson (B). Very interesting, though too Freudian for my taste, and somewhat factually incorrect. <a href="http://www.lewisiana.nl/definitivebiography/index.htm">Here’s a thoughtful, critical review</a> of this biography.</p>
<p><em>The Four Loves</em> by C. S. Lewis (B). Discusses four kinds of love: affection, friendship, romance, and charity. Very perceptive in places, though overall not one of my favourite Lewis books.</p>
<p><em>Sleeping Murder</em> and <em>The Murder at the Vicarage</em> by Agatha Christie (F). The first and last of the Mrs Marple detective stories. A light and easy read.</p>
<p><em>Heaven is for Real</em> by Todd Burpo (F). The account of a father whose young son had a near-death experience and described things he saw in heaven, despite never having been taught about those things. Franci said it was a fascinating read, even if she didn’t agree with it all. She was expecting much worse after reading <a href="http://www.challies.com/book-reviews/heaven-is-for-real">this very negative review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lord Peter</em> (a collection of Lord Peter Whimsey stories) by Dorothy Sayers (F). Sayers is a fantastic mystery writer, and Franci marvels at how she comes up with such different scenarios for each of her stories.</p>
<p><em>Charlotte’s Web</em> by E. B. White (F). Franci read this classic to Marica recently.</p>
<p><em>The Gift of the Magi and Other Short Stories</em> by O. Henry (BF). Punchy, twist-at-the-end short stories.</p>
<p><em>Wordsmithy: Hot Tips for the Writing Life</em> by Douglas Wilson (BF). Short and fun book with things writers should think about. Not the usual list of grammatical advice.</p>
<p><em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, by C. S. Lewis (B). I just finished reading the last of these to Marica (for the second time). Brilliant, and they get better every time.</p>
