<p>How is it that they go from this…</p>

<p>to this…</p>

<p>so unbelievably fast?</p>
<p>Too fast, that’s what. I’m sure someone’s been speeding up the time.</p>
<p>Marica turned 5 in February, but when we were in New Zealand, my mum (Ouma to the kids) threw a birthday party for Marica. What fun!  Ouma made an amazing cake with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liewe_Heksie">Liewe Heksie</a> theme and we had the party in a marquis tent in front of their house, which my sister Angelique helped me to decorate.</p>

<p>Marica got a whole lot of really nice presents. Thanks, everyone!</p>

<p>Check out Liewe Heksie’s fantastic house. Mum spent days crafting the fondant decorations. The end result was really amazing!</p>

<p>Liewe Heksie and Blommie kept nice guard over the flower cupcakes.</p>

<p>There were some games, like pass the parcel,</p>

<p>which has the fun results that boys sometimes get girl presents!</p>

<p>It was a windy day so a game of Catch the Bubbles went down really well. We had 3 great older girls who came over to help with the party and the games, and they were just fantastic! Thanks, Annemarie, Danny and Anneke!</p>

<p>I don’t know why I thought it was a good idea to buy party noise makers, but the kids enjoyed them!</p>

<p>Oh, just look at my adorable little nephew! Tyson is my sister Angelique’s son, and he’s the sweetest, happiest baby I’ve ever met.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/03/dsc_6772-large.jpg"><img title="Angelique and Tyson" src="/images/2012/03/dsc_6772-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>The party was aptly concluded with a piano solo from Marica that she had practised (and made up) for days beforehand.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/03/dsc_6841-large.jpg"><img title="Marica's piano performance" src="/images/2012/03/dsc_6841-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks, Ouma, for throwing Marica such a lovely party! She talked about it for weeks afterward.</p>
