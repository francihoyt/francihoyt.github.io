<p>I love markets of any kind, but I especially like farmers’ markets. I can’t explain it — they just make me happy in the same way that flowers make me happy. On Saturdays there is a farmers’ market at Prospect Park, and we’ve been there a couple of times.</p>
<p>Last time we were there, I took some photos.</p>

<p>A small sample of some of the foods they sell:</p>

<p>They sell plants too, that vary according to the season (before Christmas they sell wreaths and Christmas trees).</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/04/hpim0450-large.jpg"><img title="Pretty potted plants" src="/images/2012/04/hpim0450-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>New York doesn’t have a council-run compost collection system, so if you’re particularly concerned about that, you can bring your compost to the market.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/04/hpim0455-large.jpg"><img title="Bring your compost" src="/images/2012/04/hpim0455-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>There was even a group doing Irish/Country music,</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/04/dsc_7747-large.jpg"><img title="Live musicians playing country/irish music" src="/images/2012/04/dsc_7747-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>and a puppeteer.</p>

<p>Maybe you think I’m strange, but I think farmers’ markets are beautiful!</p>
