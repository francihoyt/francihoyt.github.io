<p>I think the Pennsylvanian countryside is just <em>so</em> beautiful. It seems very peaceful to me, perhaps because I’m usually on holiday when I’m there.</p>

<p>When we took Lizel there when she visited, Marica stayed with dear friends who took her to a ballet concert, so Esther got to be the only child for a weekend. She seemed to oscillate between really missing Marica and really liking being the only kid.</p>

<p>With Esther being the only kid, it meant that she got some nice special times with us one-on-one, and I took some photos of her hanging out with her Pappa. I think they’re beautiful!</p>
