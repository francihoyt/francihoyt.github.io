<p>The girls and I arrived safely back in New York City on Monday night after three flights over 26 hours. We had a fantastic time back in New Zealand reconnecting with friends and family and enjoying Jeremy and Lillian’s wedding, but we’re very happy to be home with Ben again!</p>
<p>I took over a thousand photos during the last 3 weeks, so I have a lot of photos to sort out and edit and turn into blog posts over the next few weeks. Jetlag has hit us pretty bad coming back here though, so it might take a little while. In the mean time I have a few pretty photos to share and some recipes in the draft blog post folder that will be coming out while I get back on track with life here.</p>
