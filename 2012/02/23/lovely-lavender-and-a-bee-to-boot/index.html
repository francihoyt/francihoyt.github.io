<p>I’ve got so many photos I’d like to share from my time in New Zealand, but time is eluding me. The photos in the post today <em>were</em> taken in Christchurch, in the new Cashel Mall where they have a mall made out of shipping containers that have been refurbished, and looks way better than it sounds.</p>
<p>There were these flower boxes with lavender in them and I had fun taking some close-up photos of the lavender, and then got very spoiled with a bee that I got some excellent shots of. I think that these aren’t too bad just for a standard kit-set 18-55mm lens.</p>

<p>Just look at those beautiful wings!</p>

<p>Do you have some of the mall?  We met some Kiwi’s last fall that were telling us about the shipping containers on Cashel.  Sounded like a creative [temporary] solution!</p>

<p>They are beautiful photos - Robert’s just gotten some canvas wall prints done (that he had a voucher for), or he might be asking to use one of your photos!</p>

<p>I agree - they are beautiful photos! The detail in the wings is amazing. Enjoying your posts very much, Franci! And yes, the container mall is something special, and much more interesting and creative in real life than the initial images that the name brings to mind. Looking forward to some more photos!</p>
