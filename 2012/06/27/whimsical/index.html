<p>I love this photo — I took it when we were in the Smoky Mountains with the Holders.</p>
<p>Consider this a teaser until I get a post up with the rest of our photos from our time in Knoxville. I’m working on it, it’ll be up in the next day or two, I hope! We are currently in Tyler, Texas, and hope to travel to Dallas tomorrow. The Hoyt reunion was absolutely fantastic, and we had a lovely time visiting with old family friends in Ben’s birth town of Atoka, TN before we came here. It’s really great hanging out with the family here — I wish we were here longer than just two nights!</p>
