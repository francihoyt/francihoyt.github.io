<p>After our first stop in Connecticut with the Snoeks, we headed down to Philadelphia where we stayed with Lillian and Jeremy and visited with several friends over the course of the weekend.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9784-large.jpg"><img title="Jeremy and Lillian" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9784-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>On the way to Lillian and Jeremy we stopped and Sam and Emily Perez’s home, friends from our church in New York. They’ve just recently had their first baby, the tiniest little boy named Adam.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9764-large.jpg"><img title="Sam, Emily and little David" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9764-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>The next day we had lunch with the Braunings which we were very grateful to be able to do. Mrs Brauning served the world’s most amazing hamburgers, according to Ben!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9770-large.jpg"><img title="The Braunings" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9770-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Mrs Brauning recently fell and broke her hip, and we were encouraged to see how well she’s doing now. Since her operation they’ve had this chair installed to help her up and down the stairs, and Mr Brauning was just as excited as the kids about them getting a ride on it!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9775-large.jpg"><img title="The ride down" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9775-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="448" height="675" /></a></p>
<p>On Sunday we went to church with Jeremy and Lillian and then drove to Pottstown to have lunch with Uncle Sherwood and Aunt Sharon, and their children Jonathan and Esther. We had a yummy lunch and some great cupcakes Esther had made for dessert.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9780-large.jpg"><img title="The Hoyts" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9780-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>From there we were off to dinner at Jeremy’s parents’ place, which was an evening of fantastic food and company once again.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9820-large.jpg"><img title="The Eshelmans" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9820-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>Jeremy’s parents have a closed in porch and the light that evening was so lovely (along with the food!) that I had a fun time taking some photos.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9800-large.jpg"><img title="Lovely light" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9800-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9790-large.jpg"><img title="Esther on the porch" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9790-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9811-large.jpg"><img title="Around the table" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9811-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9807-large.jpg"><img title="Roasted cherry tomatoes" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9807-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>On Monday we drove down to Lexington, VA, where we stayed for the night on our way to Knoxville, TN.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9825-large.jpg"><img title="The I-95" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9825-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>On the way to Lexington we stopped outside Baltimore for a nice picnic lunch at a park before carrying on on the rest of our drive.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9827-large.jpg"><img title="Baltimore" src="/images/2012/06/dsc_9827-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" /></a><a href="/images/2012/06/dsc_9825-large.jpg"> </a></p>
<p>Now we are in Knoxville, staying with Ben’s Uncle Ron and Aunt Marti, and having a great time with them and Hannah and Eva.</p>
<p>Some people have asked what our itinerary is for the rest of our roadtrip, so here is a quick list of the stops we hope to make until the end of July:</p>
<p>Atlanta, GA, visiting our friends the Roses<br>
Forsyth, GA, for a Hoyt reunion<br>
Atoka, TN, visiting some old family friends of Ben’s parents<br>
Tyler, TX, visiting family<br>
Dallas, TX, visiting family<br>
Amarillo, TX, a stop-over on our way to<br>
(Just outside) Colorado Springs, CO, for a Tschetter reunion<br>
Colorado Springs, CO, visiting a cousin and her family<br>
Arches National Park,<br>
Grand Canyon National Park,<br>
Phoenix, to visit family<br>
Las Vegas, to make our millions (yeah right)<br>
Lone Pine (via the Death Valley), an overnight stay on our way to<br>
Yosemite National Park (via Mono Lake),<br>
San Francisco,<br>
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Wow, typing that reminds me what an amazing opportunity we have to do this! It also reminds me what a big country this is — <em>lots</em> of driving still before we get to Los Angeles!</p>

<p>The Roses will be, by far, the best stop! in my unbiased opinion</p>

<p>We’ll enjoy catching up with all our mutual friends and relatives, as you go!  Hi, Eshelmans, Eshelmans, and Sherwood and Sharon, Jonathan and Esther!</p>
<p>Wow, are you stopping at the Walkers’ place in Atoka? - If so, I wonder if they still have the laundry chute from the bedroom, that I thought was so neat as a child…Your girls would love it.</p>
