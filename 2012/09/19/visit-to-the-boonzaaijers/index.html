<p>So, getting around to posting these last roadtrip posts have crawled to a terribly slow pace, but I’m determined to finish them up. When I get to that point, I’ll evaluate whether or not I keep AliensInTheApple going, or change its name, or just say “So long, and thanks for all the fish.”</p>
<p>But, moving on in our roadtrip, we spent a wonderful 4 nights in Colorado Springs at Ben’s cousin Erica and her family’s place. We had a really great time getting to know them all better (having only met Stephen and the kids at the Hoyt reunion). They are a really fun family, and I was encouraged by what great parents they are — I learned a lot by just observing them!</p>
<p>Erica is married to Stephen, who is a great baker (I speak from experience!). We enjoyed many treats from their Dutch bakery, and even got a tour of it.</p>

<p>One afternoon after Stephen got home from work, he took the kids (and us) out to a nearby reservoir to do some fishing.</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_1842-large.jpg"><img title="Stephen " src="/images/2012/09/dsc_1842-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>

<p>Esther’s favourite part was finding bugs and wildflowers.</p>

<p>One afternoon Ben and I went with Stephen to drop off some wedding cakes that he had made to see how he assembles them and gets them all prettied up for the wedding. I must admit I felt a bit nervous about this method of transport, but apparently they’ve never lost a cake in transport!</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_1764-large.jpg"><img title="Taking the cake to the wedding reception at Glen Eyrie" src="/images/2012/09/dsc_1764-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>This one we dropped off at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Eyrie">Glen Eyrie</a>, a beautiful old castle. While we were there, I took the opportunity to take some photos of the grounds and building while everyone else decided whether the cake should be left inside our outside (there was a storm brewing). What an impressive place!</p>

<p>About a week before our visit to the Boonzaaijers, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_Canyon_fire">Waldo Canyon fire</a> saw them evacuated from their home and bakery for a few days, so we weren’t even sure we’d be able to visit them, but thankfully it was contained, and although the fire came <em>close</em> to their house, their home and business was spared. The fire also came to the hills right behind Glen Eyrie, as you can see here:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_1813-large.jpg"><img title="The fires came very close" src="/images/2012/09/dsc_1813-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>All over town there were posters thanking firefighters and I saw this card on a table at Glen Eyrie:</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_1775-large.jpg"><img title="card on one at the tables at Glen Eyrie" src="/images/2012/09/dsc_1775-large.jpg" class="portrait" alt="" width="510" height="768" /></a></p>
<p>I totally forgot to get a whole family shot of the Boonzaaijers, so in the end I just took a photo of the two cousins, Ben and Erica. (Stephen and Erica’s baby has since been born, and it’s a cute little girl named Tabitha.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_2086-large.jpg"><img title="Ben and his cousin Erica" src="/images/2012/09/dsc_2086-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>And I just have to leave you with this: spot the gecko! (I promise there really <em>is</em> one! If you click on it, you’ll get a bigger picture.)</p>
<p><a class="img-link" href="/images/2012/09/dsc_1815-large.jpg"><img title="Spot the gecko!" src="/images/2012/09/dsc_1815-large.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>One of the mornings we were staying with them I went back to Garden of the Gods, seeing that I had lost all my previous photos when my computer crashed. This was way better anyway, going at sunrise, and I got some great shots that I’ll share with you next time.</p>

<p>Glen Eyrie looks like a great wedding venue.  And Esther looks like a “blow flower.”</p>

<p>Thanks for the post, Franci!  I’ve so enjoyed getting bits of your journey via the blog!  I’m checking my email in probably the most unusual spot I’ve ever experienced — while on the train from Graz to Vienna.  We’ve just had a week of English teacher training held at a castle, so the pictures seem a bit familiar.</p>

<p>I see Ben got a tee-shirt with the American flag on it. Yay!!</p>
<p>We’ve been to Glen Eyrie; it is very beautiful.  A General Assembly of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (no longer in existence since it joined the PCA) was held there once, many years ago.</p>

<p>Thanks for sending through a bit more about your trip - and enjoyed seeing the Boonzaijers and the bakery too!  We’ll patiently await the remainder of the posts; I know it feels hard to catch up with everything when arriving home from a holiday, let alone a two-year stint overseas.</p>
