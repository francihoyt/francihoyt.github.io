<p>Those of you who have been following the blog for any time over the last 2.5 years or so will have noticed that there has been a marked drop in the frequency of posts here. The reason for that has partly been that coming back to New Zealand has made life busier in many ways and that the time to blog has diminished.</p>
<p>But given that I usually blog at night once the kids are in bed, you’d think I’d have just as much time as before, right? The only thing is that these days I often go to bed around the same time as the kids because I’m simply e.x.h.a.u.s.t.e.d! I might as well just get to the point here: we’re expecting baby number 3! He or she is due, Lord willing, on the 8th of June next year (making me 12 weeks along to those who are interested in these kinds of things).</p>
<p>There’s a fair bit of excitement around here, mingled with some very difficult days. It looks as if this is going to be another highly monitored pregnancy in regards to hyperemesis and high blood pressure, both of which I’m on medication for already. But, we had our 12-week ultrasound on Friday and little Blobby was looking healthy and normal and was actively doing somersaults and carrying on merrily, so he or she seems to feel unaffected by my misery, which is a happy thing.</p>
<p>I’m contemplating naming the kid Caroma, which is the brand of our toilet bowl. I’ve become very intimate with the view of the inside of our toilet bowl, and Caroma and I are getting very well acquainted — so maybe it would be a fitting tribute to name the kid Caroma. What do you guys think? ;-)</p>

<p>Funny story.  Caroma sounds like Corona beer to me. You and little one are in my prayers.  Love you a ton.</p>
